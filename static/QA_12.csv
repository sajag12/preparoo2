Shyam's salary (S = 100x) is 25% less than Mohan's salary (M).
So, 100x = M * (1 - 25/100) = M * 0.75.
M = 100x / 0.75 = 100x / (3/4) = 400x/3.
Given Mohan's salary is Rs. 4000 more than Ram's salary: M = R + 4000.
400x/3 = 120x + 4000.
Multiply by 3: 400x = 360x + 12000.

First, we consider the sign of the right-hand side.
Case 1: 2x + 1 < 0 (i.e., x < -1/2).
In this case, the LHS is an absolute value (always >= 0) and the RHS is negative. The inequality is always true. So, (-∞, -1/2) is part of the solution.
Case 2: 2x + 1 >= 0 (i.e., x >= -1/2).
Since both sides are non-negative, we can square both sides: (3x - 5)² >= (2x + 1)².
9x² - 30x + 25 >= 4x² + 4x + 1.
5x² - 34x + 24 >= 0.

The roots are x = (34+26)/10 = 6 and x = (34-26)/10 = 8/10 = 4/5.
Since the parabola 5x² - 34x + 24 opens upwards, the expression is >= 0 for x <= 4/5 or x >= 6.
Now, we must intersect this with the condition for Case 2 (x >= -1/2).
Intersection of (x <= 4/5 or x >= 6) with (x >= -1/2) is [-1/2, 4/5] U [6, ∞).
Finally, we combine the results from Case 1 and Case 2:
(-∞, -1/2) U [-1/2, 4/5] U [6, ∞).
This simplifies to (-∞, 4/5] U [6, ∞)."

So, ∠DAB = 90°.
AP bisects ∠DAB, which means ∠DAP = ∠PAB = 90°/2 = 45°.
Consider the triangle ΔADP. It is a right-angled triangle because ∠D = 90°.
We know ∠DAP = 45°. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so ∠APD = 180° - 90° - 45° = 45°.
Since two angles (∠DAP and ∠APD) are equal, ΔADP is a right-angled isosceles triangle.
Therefore, the sides opposite to the equal angles are equal: AD = DP.
We are given BC = 12 cm. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 12 cm.
This means DP = 12 cm.
The length of side CD is equal to the length of side AB, so CD = 16 cm.
We need to find the length of CP. CP = CD - DP.
CP = 16 - 12 = 4 cm."

Fraction of milk in Vessel A (M_A) = 5 / (5+3) = 5/8.
Fraction of milk in Vessel B (M_B) = 4 / (4+1) = 4/5.
Fraction of milk in the final New Mixture (M_Mix) = 2 / (2+1) = 2/3.
Let Q_A and Q_B be the quantities taken from vessels A and B respectively. By the rule of alligation:
(Q_A / Q_B) = (M_B - M_Mix) / (M_Mix - M_A)
(Q_A / Q_B) = |(2/3 - 4/5)| / |(2/3 - 5/8)|  <-- Note: It should be |M_Mix - M_B| / |M_A - M_Mix|
(Q_A / Q_B) = |(10-12)/15| / |(16-15)/24|
(Q_A / Q_B) = |-2/15| / |1/24|
(Q_A / Q_B) = (2/15) / (1/24)
(Q_A / Q_B) = (2/15) * 24 = 48/15 = 16/5.

To find the smallest such positive integer, we should assume the smallest possible integer value for the final quotient, q3. The smallest non-negative integer is 0.
Let q3 = 0.
Working backwards:
q2 = 3 * (0) + 2 = 2.
q1 = 4 * (2) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.
N = 5 * (9) + 2 = 45 + 2 = 47.
Therefore, the smallest such positive integer is 47."
