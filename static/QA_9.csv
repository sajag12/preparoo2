QA,,Q67,1,,,"A shopkeeper marks up his goods by 50% above his cost price. He then offers a discount of 20% on the marked price. Due to a faulty weighing machine, he sells only 900 grams for every 1 kg he bills.

Due to the supplier's faulty machine, he gets 1100 grams for Rs. 1000.
So, his effective cost for 1100 grams is Rs. 1000.
His effective cost per gram = Rs. 1000 / 1100 = Rs. 10/11.
He marks up his goods by 50% above his perceived cost price (assume he perceives his CP as Rs. 1000 for 1000g, or Rs. 1 per gram for marking purposes).
Marked Price (MP) per gram (label) = Rs. 1 * 1.50 = Rs. 1.50.
MP for 1 kg (label) = Rs. 1500.
He offers a 20% discount on MP.
Selling Price (SP) per gram (label) = Rs. 1.50 * 0.80 = Rs. 1.20.
SP for 1 kg (label) = Rs. 1200.
Due to his faulty machine, he sells only 900 grams when he bills for 1 kg.
So, he receives Rs. 1200 for selling 900 grams of goods.
The actual cost of these 900 grams for him = 900 grams * (Rs. 10/11 per gram) = Rs. 9000/11.
Profit = SP for 900g - Cost of 900g
Profit = Rs. 1200 - Rs. 9000/11 = (Rs. 13200 - Rs. 9000) / 11 = Rs. 4200/11.
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost of 900g) * 100
= ( (4200/11) / (9000/11) ) * 100
= (4200 / 9000) * 100

Approximate net profit percentage = 46.67%."
QA,,Q78,2,,,"If log₂(x) + log₄(x) + log₁₆(x) = 21/4, what is the value of x?",4,8,16,32,A,B,C,D,B,MCQ,Algebra,Logarithms,Easy,"Logarithms, Properties of Logarithms, Change of Base","Logarithms, Properties of Logarithms, Change of Base",FALSE,MockSet3_QA,,"The given equation is log₂(x) + log₄(x) + log₁₆(x) = 21/4.
To solve this, we convert all logarithms to a common base, preferably base 2.
Recall the logarithm property: log_{b^k}(M) = (1/k)log_b(M).
Using this property:
log₄(x) = log_{2²}(x) = (1/2)log₂(x).
log₁₆(x) = log_{2⁴}(x) = (1/4)log₂(x).
Substitute these expressions back into the original equation:
log₂(x) + (1/2)log₂(x) + (1/4)log₂(x) = 21/4.
Let y = log₂(x). The equation becomes:
y + y/2 + y/4 = 21/4.
To combine the terms on the left side, find a common denominator, which is 4:
(4y/4) + (2y/4) + (y/4) = 21/4.
(4y + 2y + y) / 4 = 21/4.
7y / 4 = 21/4.
Multiply both sides by 4:
7y = 21.
Divide by 7:
y = 3.
Since y = log₂(x), we have:
log₂(x) = 3.
By the definition of logarithm (if log_b(a) = c, then a = b^c):
x = 2³
x = 8."

AD is the internal angle bisector of ∠A.
By Angle Bisector Theorem, BD/DC = AB/AC = 20/28 = 5/7.
Since BD + DC = BC = 24, we have BD = (5/(5+7)) * 24 = (5/12) * 24 = 10 cm.
DC = (7/12) * 24 = 14 cm.
E is the midpoint of AD. BE is extended to meet AC at F.
We can use Mass Point Geometry.
Place masses m_B at B and m_C at C such that D is their center of mass.
m_B * BD = m_C * DC => m_B * 10 = m_C * 14 => m_B/m_C = 14/10 = 7/5.
Let m_B = 7 units and m_C = 5 units.
The mass at D, m_D = m_B + m_C = 7 + 5 = 12 units.
Now, E is the midpoint of AD. For E to be the center of mass of A and D, if mass at D is m_D = 12, then mass at A, m_A, must also be 12 (m_A * AE = m_D * DE, and AE=DE).
So, m_A = 12 units.
The line BEF passes through F on AC. F is the center of mass for A and C (with masses m_A and m_C) if B, E, F are collinear.
The masses at A and C are m_A = 12 and m_C = 5.
For F on AC, AF/FC = m_C/m_A = 5/12.
The length of AF = (m_C / (m_A + m_C)) * AC = (5 / (12 + 5)) * 28
AF = (5/17) * 28 = 140/17 cm."
QA,,Q76,4,,,"When a positive integer N is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. When N is divided by 11, the remainder is 7.

1. When N is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. This can be written as N ≡ 2 (mod 7).
2. When N is divided by 11, the remainder is 7. This can be written as N ≡ 7 (mod 11).
We need to find the remainder when N is divided by 77. Let this remainder be R.
So, N ≡ R (mod 77). This implies R < 77.
From N ≡ R (mod 77), we have R ≡ N ≡ 2 (mod 7) and R ≡ N ≡ 7 (mod 11).
We need to find a number R (0 ≤ R < 77) that satisfies these two congruences.
We can list numbers satisfying the second congruence (N ≡ 7 (mod 11)) and check their remainder when divided by 7:
Possible values for R (or N) are 7, 18 (11+7), 29 (22+7), 40 (33+7), 51 (44+7), 62 (55+7), 73 (66+7).
Now check these values with the first congruence (R ≡ 2 (mod 7)):
• 7 mod 7 = 0 (not 2)
• 18 mod 7 = 4 (not 2)
• 29 mod 7 = 1 (not 2)
• 40 mod 7 = 5 (not 2)
• 51 mod 7 = 2 (since 51 = 7 × 7 + 2). This matches.
So, R = 51 is a possible remainder. Since 0 ≤ 51 < 77, this is the required remainder."

Given a ≠ b and they have exactly one root in common. Let the common root be α.
Then α satisfies both equations:
α² + aα + b = 0
α² + bα + a = 0
Subtracting the second from the first:
(aα + b) - (bα + a) = 0
aα - bα + b - a = 0
α(a - b) - (a - b) = 0
(a - b)(α - 1) = 0
Since a ≠ b, (a - b) ≠ 0. Therefore, we must have α - 1 = 0, which means α = 1.
The common root is 1.
Substitute α = 1 into equation (1) (or (2)):
(1)² + a(1) + b = 0
1 + a + b = 0
a + b = -1.
To ensure there's exactly one common root, the other roots must be different.
Roots of (1) are 1 and β₁. Product of roots = 1 * β₁ = b => β₁ = b.
Roots of (2) are 1 and β₂. Product of roots = 1 * β₂ = a => β₂ = a.
If there is only one common root, then β₁ ≠ β₂ (i.e., b ≠ a), which is given.
Also, the common root α=1 should not be equal to the other root of the same equation if that other root is also common.
If β₁ = 1, then b=1. If β₂ = 1, then a=1.
If a=1, b=-2 (since a+b=-1). Eq1: x²+x-2=0 => (x-1)(x+2)=0. Roots 1, -2.
Eq2: x²-2x+1=0 => (x-1)²=0. Roots 1, 1.

B leaves 4 days before scheduled completion, so B works for 20 - 4 = 16 days. (This interpretation is if ""scheduled completion"" is fixed).
The question says ""B leaves 4 days before the scheduled completion of work"". This usually means if the work was supposed to end in T_sched days, B leaves at T_sched - 4.
However, the phrasing ""actual completion"" implies the schedule might change.
A more standard interpretation: Let D be the actual number of days the work was completed.
A works for D days. Work done by A = 2D.
B leaves 4 days before actual completion, so B works for (D-4) days. Work by B = 3(D-4).
C leaves 2 days before actual completion, so C works for (D-2) days. Work by C = 1(D-2).
Total work = 2D + 3(D-4) + 1(D-2) = 120.

P(R then B then G) = P(1st is R) * P(2nd is B | 1st is R) * P(3rd is G | 1st is R, 2nd is B)
= (4/15) * (5/14) * (6/13)
= (4 * 5 * 6) / (15 * 14 * 13) = 120 / 2730.
Since there are 6 such equally probable orders, the total probability is:
P(3 different colors) = 6 * P(R then B then G)
= 6 * (120 / 2730) = 720 / 2730.
Simplify the fraction:
720/2730 = 72/273.
Both 72 and 273 are divisible by 3:
72 = 3 * 24
273 = 3 * 91
So, 72/273 = 24/91.
The prime factorization of 91 is 7 * 13. 24 is not divisible by 7 or 13.
So, the fraction 24/91 is in simplest form.
Here, a = 24 and b = 91.
a + b = 24 + 91 = 115."

Step 1: x₁ = 10 L removed and replaced with water.
Fraction of milk remaining = (V - x₁)/V = (100 - 10)/100 = 90/100 = 0.9.
Quantity of milk M₁ = M₀ * 0.9 = 100 * 0.9 = 90 L.
Step 2: x₂ = 20 L removed and replaced with water.
Fraction of milk remaining from this step (applied to current milk quantity) = (V - x₂)/V = (100 - 20)/100 = 80/100 = 0.8.
Quantity of milk M₂ = M₁ * 0.8 = 90 * 0.8 = 72 L.
Step 3: x₃ = 25 L removed and replaced with water.
Fraction of milk remaining from this step = (V - x₃)/V = (100 - 25)/100 = 75/100 = 0.75.
Quantity of milk M₃ = M₂ * 0.75 = 72 * 0.75 = 72 * (3/4) = 18 * 3 = 54 L.
The final quantity of milk is 54 L.
The total volume of the mixture remains 100 L.
Percentage of milk in the final mixture = (Final quantity of milk / Total volume) * 100

Alternatively, using the formula for multiple replacements:
Final Milk = Initial Milk * (1 - x₁/V) * (1 - x₂/V) * (1 - x₃/V)

The nth term (T_n) of an AP can be found using the relation T_n = S_n - S_{n-1} (for n > 1).
The first term (T₁) is equal to S₁.
T₁ = S₁ = 2(1)² + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5.
To find the second term (T₂), we first calculate S₂:
S₂ = 2(2)² + 3(2) = 2×4 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14.
T₂ = S₂ - S₁ = 14 - 5 = 9.
The common difference (d) of the AP is T₂ - T₁ = 9 - 5 = 4.
The formula for the nth term of an AP is T_n = a + (n-1)d, where 'a' is the first term.
Here, a = 5 and d = 4.
So, T_n = 5 + (n-1)4 = 5 + 4n - 4 = 4n + 1.

Substitute back y = |x-3|:
2 ≤ |x-3| ≤ 6.
This can be broken into two separate inequalities:
1. |x-3| ≥ 2
2. |x-3| ≤ 6
For 1) |x-3| ≥ 2:
This means x-3 ≥ 2 OR x-3 ≤ -2.
So, x ≥ 5 OR x ≤ 1.
For 2) |x-3| ≤ 6:

Adding 3 to all parts: -6 + 3 ≤ x ≤ 6 + 3, which simplifies to -3 ≤ x ≤ 9.
We need to find integers x that satisfy both conditions: (x ≥ 5 OR x ≤ 1) AND (-3 ≤ x ≤ 9).
