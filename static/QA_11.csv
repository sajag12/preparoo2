Substitute this into the equation x to the power y = y to the power x:

(2 to the power y) * (y to the power y) = (y to the power y) * (y to the power y).
Since y is a positive integer, y > 0. So, y to the power y > 0. We can divide both sides by y to the power y:
2 to the power y = y to the power y.
Since y is a positive integer, this implies y=2.
If y=2, then x=2y=4.

Consider the triangle O1PO2, where P is an intersection point of the circles. O1P=r=6, O2P=r=6, and O1O2=d=6. Thus, triangle O1PO2 is equilateral.
The angle angle PO1O2 = 60 degrees = pi/3 radians.
The angle subtended by the common chord at the center of C1 (let the intersection points be P and Q) is 2 * 60 degrees = 120 degrees = 2pi/3 radians.

Angle A = 40 degrees. So, Angle B + Angle C = 140 degrees.
O is the meeting point of bisectors of Angle B and Angle C.
In triangle BOC, Angle OBC = (Angle B)/2, Angle OCB = (Angle C)/2.
Angle BOC + Angle OBC + Angle OCB = 180 degrees.
Angle BOC + (Angle B)/2 + (Angle C)/2 = 180 degrees.
Angle BOC + (Angle B + Angle C)/2 = 180 degrees.
Angle BOC + 140/2 = 180 degrees.
Angle BOC + 70 = 180 degrees => Angle BOC = 110 degrees."

Let quantities be 2k, 3k, 5k. Total = 10k.
20 litres drawn off.
A removed = (2/10)*20 = 4L. B removed = (3/10)*20 = 6L. C removed = (5/10)*20 = 10L.
Remaining: A_rem = 2k-4, B_rem = 3k-6, C_rem = 5k-10.
10 litres of A added.
New A = (2k-4)+10 = 2k+6.
New B = 3k-6.
New C = 5k-10.
New ratio A:B = 1:1.
(2k+6)/(3k-6) = 1/1.
2k+6 = 3k-6 => k=12.
Initial quantity of C = 5k = 5 * 12 = 60 litres."
