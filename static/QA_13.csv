What is the value of k?",MCQ,MockSet1_QA_Final_Q1,QA,40,MockSet1_QA_Final,"Let Rohan's Cost Price (CP_R) be C.
Rohan sells to Bimal at a 20% profit. So, Bimal's Cost Price (CP_B) = C * (1 + 20/100) = 1.2C.
Bimal marks up the price by 25%. Marked Price (MP_B) = CP_B * (1 + 25/100) = 1.2C * 1.25 = 1.5C.
Bimal sells to Charan at a 10% discount. Charan's Cost Price (CP_C) = MP_B * (1 - 10/100) = 1.5C * 0.9 = 1.35C.
Given that Charan paid ₹2700, so CP_C = 1.35C = 2700.
This implies C = 2700 / 1.35 = ₹2000. So, Rohan's original cost price was ₹2000.
If Rohan had sold the article directly to Charan at ₹2700, Rohan's profit would be:
Profit = Selling Price to Charan - Rohan's CP_R = ₹2700 - ₹2000 = ₹700.
Rohan's profit percentage k% = (Profit / CP_R) * 100 = (700 / 2000) * 100 = (7/20) * 100 = 35%.

According to the problem statement:

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
(F + 250V) - (F + 200V) = 1800 - 1500

V = 300 / 50 = 6.
So, the variable charge is ₹6 per unit.
Substitute V = 6 into Equation 1:
F + 200(6) = 1500
F + 1200 = 1500
F = 1500 - 1200 = 300.

C is 20% less efficient than B. So, C's work per day W_C = W_B * (1 - 20/100) = (1/16) * 0.80 = (1/16) * (4/5) = 1/20 of the job per day.

Equation 1 becomes: log₂(x) + (1/2)log₂(y) = 4.

Five years hence, their ages will be A+5 and B+5. The ratio will be (A+5)/(B+5) = 4/5.
This implies 5(A+5) = 4(B+5) => 5A + 25 = 4B + 20 => 5A - 4B = -5. (Equation 2)
A common way to solve this is to let A-5 = 3k and B-5 = 4k for some constant k.
Then A = 3k+5 and B = 4k+5.
Substitute these into the second condition (ages five years hence):
Amit's age: (3k+5)+5 = 3k+10.
Binit's age: (4k+5)+5 = 4k+10.
So, (3k+10)/(4k+10) = 4/5.
5(3k+10) = 4(4k+10)
15k + 50 = 16k + 40
k = 50 - 40 = 10.
Current age of Amit A = 3k+5 = 3(10)+5 = 35 years.

Length of MN = (PQ + RS) / 2 = (6 + 10) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8 cm.
The perpendicular distance (height) between PQ and RS is 8 cm. This is the height of the main trapezium PQRS.
Since MN is parallel to PQ and RS and connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides, it divides the height of the trapezium PQRS into two equal parts.
So, the height of trapezium PQNM (the part between PQ and MN) is (Total height of PQRS) / 2 = 8 cm / 2 = 4 cm.
The area of a trapezium is given by (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height.
Area of trapezium PQNM = (1/2) * (PQ + MN) * (height of PQNM)
Area(PQNM) = (1/2) * (6 + 8) * 4 = (1/2) * 14 * 4 = 7 * 4 = 28 cm².",Quadrilaterals & Polygons,Geometry

Finally, he sold 1/3 of the apples now remaining plus 8 apples to the third customer. If he was left with 12 apples, how many apples did he have initially?",TITA,MockSet1_QA_Final_Q17,QA,40,MockSet1_QA_Final,"Let A_initial be the initial number of apples.
We work backwards from the number of apples left.
Apples left at the end = 12.
Before the 3rd customer sale, let the number of apples be A3.
The 3rd customer bought (1/3)A3 + 8 apples.
So, A3 - [(1/3)A3 + 8] = 12
(2/3)A3 - 8 = 12
(2/3)A3 = 20
A3 = 20 * (3/2) = 30 apples.
Before the 2nd customer sale, let the number of apples be A2. (So A2 was the remainder after 1st customer).
The 2nd customer bought (1/2)A2 + 6 apples. The remainder was A3 = 30.
So, A2 - [(1/2)A2 + 6] = 30
(1/2)A2 - 6 = 30
(1/2)A2 = 36
A2 = 72 apples.
Before the 1st customer sale, let the number of apples be A1 (which is A_initial).
The 1st customer bought (1/3)A1 + 4 apples. The remainder was A2 = 72.
So, A1 - [(1/3)A1 + 4] = 72
(2/3)A1 - 4 = 72
(2/3)A1 = 76
A1 = 76 * (3/2) = 38 * 3 = 114 apples.

The person can only move right (R) or up (U). However, the path cannot pass through point X(2,1). How many distinct paths are possible from A to B under this condition?",MCQ,MockSet1_QA_Final_Q18,QA,40,MockSet1_QA_Final,"The person needs to travel from A(0,0) to B(4,3). This requires making 4 Right (R) moves and 3 Up (U) moves. The total number of moves is 4 + 3 = 7.
The total number of distinct paths from A to B without any restrictions is given by the combination formula C(Total moves, Number of R moves) or C(Total moves, Number of U moves).
Total paths = C(7, 4) = C(7, 3) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35.
The path cannot pass through point X(2,1). To find the number of such paths, we first find the number of paths that do pass through X and subtract this from the total number of paths.
A path passing through X consists of a path from A(0,0) to X(2,1) followed by a path from X(2,1) to B(4,3).
1. Number of paths from A(0,0) to X(2,1): This requires 2 R moves and 1 U move. Total moves = 2 + 1 = 3.
Paths_AX = C(3, 2) = C(3, 1) = 3.
2. Number of paths from X(2,1) to B(4,3): This requires (4-2) = 2 R moves and (3-1) = 2 U moves. Total moves = 2 + 2 = 4.
Paths_XB = C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 6.
The number of paths from A to B that pass through X is Paths_AX * Paths_XB = 3 * 6 = 18.
The number of distinct paths from A to B that do not pass through X is:

Applying,Using Vieta's formulas for a cubic equation whose roots are in arithmetic progression.,71,"Cubic Equations, Roots in Arithmetic Progression, Vieta's Formulas",Medium,True,,,,,,,,,,,19,The roots of the cubic equation x³ - 15x² + kx - 105 = 0 are in arithmetic progression.

From Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is:
(α-δ) + α + (α+δ) = -(-15)/1
3α = 15
α = 5.
Since α = 5 is a root of the equation, it must satisfy the equation. Substitute x = 5 into the polynomial:
(5)³ - 15(5)² + k(5) - 105 = 0
125 - 15(25) + 5k - 105 = 0
125 - 375 + 5k - 105 = 0
Calculating the constants: 125 - 375 = -250.
So, -250 + 5k - 105 = 0

The scheduled time of journey T = D/S = 300/S hours.
Monday's journey:
The bus started 30 minutes (0.5 hours) late.
It reached its destination on schedule, which means the actual travel time was T - 0.5 hours.
Actual travel time = (300/S) - 0.5 hours.
The first half of the distance (150 km) was covered at speed S. Time taken T1 = 150/S hours.
The remaining half of the distance (150 km) was covered at speed 1.25S (25% increase). Time taken T2 = 150 / (1.25S) = 150 / (5S/4) = (150 * 4) / (5S) = 120/S hours.
Total actual travel time = T1 + T2 = 150/S + 120/S = 270/S hours.
Equating the actual travel time: 270/S = 300/S - 0.5
0.5 = 300/S - 270/S
0.5 = 30/S
S = 30 / 0.5 = 60 km/hr.

We use the algebraic identities:
(a+b)² = a² + b² + 2ab
(a+b)² = 289 + 2(120) = 289 + 240 = 529.
Since a and b are positive, a+b must be positive. So, a+b = √529 = 23.
(a-b)² = a² + b² - 2ab
(a-b)² = 289 - 2(120) = 289 - 240 = 49.
Since a > b, a-b must be positive. So, a-b = √49 = 7.
We need to evaluate the expression (a³ + b³) / ((a+b)(a-b)).
Numerator: a³ + b³ = (a+b)(a² - ab + b²)
We can rewrite a² - ab + b² as (a² + b²) - ab.
So, a³ + b³ = (a+b)((a² + b²) - ab) = 23 * (289 - 120) = 23 * 169.
Denominator: (a+b)(a-b) = 23 * 7.

Rate of A = Total work / Days taken by A = 60 / 10 = 6 units/day.
Rate of B = Total work / Days taken by B = 60 / 12 = 5 units/day.
Rate of C = Total work / Days taken by C = 60 / 15 = 4 units/day.
Step 1: A, B, and C work together for 2 days.
Combined rate of A+B+C = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 units/day.
Work completed in these 2 days = 2 days * 15 units/day = 30 units.
Remaining work = Total work - Work completed = 60 - 30 = 30 units.
Step 2: A leaves. B and C continue to work together for 2 more days.
Combined rate of B+C = 5 + 4 = 9 units/day.
Work completed by B+C in these 2 days = 2 days * 9 units/day = 18 units.
