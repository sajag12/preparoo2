Charan sells an identical item to David at a 10% loss, and David pays Rs. 1125.
So, CP_C × (1 - 0.10) = 1125
CP_C × 0.90 = 1125
CP_C = 1125 / 0.90 = 11250 / 9 = Rs. 1250.
Charan's original cost price for such an item is Rs. 1250.
Charan sold the item to Bhanu making a 20% profit on his (Charan's) cost price (which is Rs. 1250).
Charan's SP to Bhanu = CP_Bhanu = CP_C × (1 + 0.20) = 1250 × 1.20 = Rs. 1500.
Bhanu sells this item to Anirudh making a 20% profit on his (Bhanu's) cost price (which is Rs. 1500).
Anirudh's CP (what Anirudh paid) = CP_Bhanu × (1 + 0.20) = 1500 × 1.20 = Rs. 1800.

The hypotenuse c is found using Pythagoras theorem: c² = a² + b²
c² = 15² + 20² = 225 + 400 = 625.
c = √625 = 25 cm.
The radius 'r' of the inscribed circle (incircle) in a right-angled triangle is given by r = (a+b-c)/2.
r = (15 + 20 - 25) / 2
r = (35 - 25) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 cm.
Alternatively, Area of triangle = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 15 × 20 = 150 sq. cm.
Semi-perimeter s = (a+b+c)/2 = (15+20+25)/2 = 60/2 = 30 cm.

From the first two conditions: N = 5k+3.

k=1, N=8. 8 mod 7 = 1 (not 4)
k=2, N=13. 13 mod 7 = 6 (not 4)
k=3, N=18. 18 mod 7 = 4. This satisfies the second condition.
So, N ≡ 18 (mod LCM(5,7)) => N ≡ 18 (mod 35).
Possible values for N are 18, 53, 88, 123, 158, ...
Now check the third condition N ≡ 5 (mod 9) for these values:
158 mod 9 = 5 (158 = 17×9 + 5). This satisfies the third condition.
The smallest three-digit number N satisfying these conditions is 158.

P(1) = A(1)² + B(1) + C = A+B+C. So, A+B+3 = 10 => A+B=7. (1)
P(-1) = A(-1)² + B(-1) + C = A-B+C. So, A-B+3 = 6 => A-B=3. (2)
Adding (1) and (2): 2A = 10 => A=5.
Substituting A=5 into (1): 5+B=7 => B=2.
The remainder R(x) = 5x² + 2x + 3.
The correct option is A."

What is the speed of Train B in km/hr? (Enter your answer as a numerical value, rounded to one decimal place if necessary)",,,,,,,,,103.5,TITA,Arithmetic,"Time, Speed & Distance (Problems on Trains)",Hard,Relative Speed of Trains,"Relative Speed of Trains, Crossing Pole, Crossing Each Other, Opposite Direction",TRUE,MockSet1_QA_V3,Analysis,"Speed of Train A (S_A) = Length / Time to cross pole = 150 m / 10 s = 15 m/s.
Let the speed of Train B be S_B. They move in opposite directions.
Relative speed S_rel = S_A + S_B = 15 + S_B.
Time to cross = Total Length / Relative Speed.
8 = (150 + 200) / (15 + S_B).
8(15 + S_B) = 350.
120 + 8S_B = 350.
8S_B = 230.
S_B = 230/8 = 115/4 = 28.75 m/s.
Convert to km/hr: S_B (km/hr) = 28.75 × (18/5) = 5.75 × 18 = 103.5 km/hr.

Quantitative Aptitude,40,Q129,19,,,Find the number of integer solutions for the inequality |x+3| > |2x-9|.,9,10,11,8,A,B,C,D,A,MCQ,Algebra,Inequalities (Linear & Quadratic),Medium,Modulus Inequalities,"Modulus Inequalities, Absolute Value, Squaring Both Sides, Number of Integer Solutions",FALSE,MockSet1_QA_V3,Application,"The inequality is |x+3| > |2x-9|.
Square both sides: (x+3)² > (2x-9)².
x² + 6x + 9 > 4x² - 36x + 81.
0 > 3x² - 42x + 72.
Divide by 3: 0 > x² - 14x + 24.
x² - 14x + 24 < 0.
Factoring: (x-12)(x-2) < 0.
The roots are x=2 and x=12. The quadratic is negative between its roots.
So, 2 < x < 12.
The integer solutions are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
Number of integers = 11 - 3 + 1 = 9.

New selling price SP_new = (4/5)SP_orig.
At this new price, loss is 10%. So, SP_new = CP × (1 - 0.10) = 0.9 CP.
Equating the two expressions for SP_new:
(4/5)SP_orig = 0.9 CP.
SP_orig = (5/4) × 0.9 CP = (4.5/4) CP = 1.125 CP.
Profit = SP_orig - CP = 1.125 CP - CP = 0.125 CP.
Profit Percentage = (Profit / CP) × 100 = (0.125 CP / CP) × 100 = 12.5%.
