Later, the cost price of the article increased by 20%, and the selling price also increased by ₹152. Due to these changes, the new profit percentage became (P-5)%. What is the value of P? (Enter your answer as an integer)",TITA,Q109,QA,40,MockSet1_QA,"Original CP = ₹800. Original profit = P%.
Original SP = 800 * (1 + P/100) = 800 + 8P.
New CP = 800 * 1.20 = ₹960.
New SP = Original SP + 152 = (800 + 8P) + 152 = 952 + 8P.
New Profit = New SP - New CP = (952 + 8P) - 960 = 8P - 8.
The new profit percentage is (New Profit / New CP) * 100.
P-5 = [(8P - 8) / 960] * 100
P-5 = [8(P-1) * 100] / 960
P-5 = (P-1) * (800 / 960) = (P-1) * (5/6).
6(P-5) = 5(P-1)
6P - 30 = 5P - 5
P = 25.
The answer is 25.","Profit, Loss & Discount",Arithmetic
Application,Relative speed application for train overtaking pedestrians.,200,"Relative Speed, Overtaking Pedestrians, Consistency Check, System of Equations",Medium,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,22,A train travelling at a certain speed overtakes a pedestrian walking in the same direction at a speed of 4 km/hr in 18 seconds. It overtakes another pedestrian walking in the same direction at a speed of 8 km/hr in 20 seconds. What is the length of the train in meters? (Enter your answer as an integer),TITA,Q110,QA,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let the length of the train be L meters and its speed be S_t m/s.
Convert pedestrian speeds to m/s:
S_p1 = 4 km/hr = 4 * (5/18) = 10/9 m/s.
S_p2 = 8 km/hr = 8 * (5/18) = 20/9 m/s.
Case 1: L = (S_t - 10/9) * 18 → L = 18*S_t - 20 (Eq. 1).
Case 2: L = (S_t - 20/9) * 20 → L = 20*S_t - 400/9 (Eq. 2).
Equating both expressions for L:
18*S_t - 20 = 20*S_t - 400/9
2*S_t = 400/9 - 20 = (400 - 180)/9 = 220/9.
S_t = 110/9 m/s.
Substitute S_t into Eq. 1 to find L:
L = 18 * (110/9) - 20 = 2 * 110 - 20 = 220 - 20 = 200.
The length of the train is 200 meters.
The answer is 200.","Time, Speed & Distance (Problems on Trains)",Arithmetic
