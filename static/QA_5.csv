Second discount = 10% on the already discounted price. Selling Price (SP) = C * (1 + (x+20)/100) * (1 - x/100) * (1 - 10/100). SP = C * ((100+x+20)/100) * ((100-x)/100) * (90/100). SP = C * ((120+x)/100) * ((100-x)/100) * 0.9. Final profit percentage = 5.3%. So, SP = C * (1 + 5.3/100) = 1.053C. Equating the SP expressions (and dividing by C): ((120+x)/100) * ((100-x)/100) * 0.9 = 1.053. (120+x)(100-x) * 0.9 = 1.053 * 10000 = 10530.

We test values for 'a', keeping in mind that a, b, c, d are distinct non-zero digits and a < b < c < d. 1. If a = 1, d = 2(1)+1 = 3. Then 1 < b < c < 3. The only integer for b would be 2.

By the properties of angles in alternate segments, ∠PAB = ∠ACB (the angle made by the tangent PA with the chord AB is equal to the angle subtended by the chord AB in the alternate segment of the circle). Also, ∠P (or ∠APB) is common to ΔPAB and ΔPCA. Therefore, ΔPAB ~ ΔPCA (Angle-Angle similarity). From similarity, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal: PA/PC = PB/PA = AB/AC. This gives two important relations: 1. PA^2 = PB * PC. Let PB = y. Then PC = PB + BC = y + 8. From PB/PA = AB/AC: PA = (AC/AB) * PB = (12/10) * y = (6/5)y. Substitute the expression for PA into the first relation: ((6/5)y)^2 = y(y+8). (36/25)y^2 = y^2 + 8y. Since P is on BC extended, y (length PB) cannot be 0. So, we can divide by y: (36/25)y = y + 8. (36/25)y - y = 8. ((36-25)/25)y = 8. (11/25)y = 8. y = (8 * 25) / 11 = 200/11. Now, calculate PA using PA = (6/5)y: PA = (6/5) * (200/11) = (6 * 40) / 11 = 240/11. The length of AP is 240/11 cm."

Let's find the intersection points. 1. 2x+7 = -x+16 => 3x = 9 => x=3. At x=3, y = 2(3)+7 = 13. 2. 2x+7 = x+10 => x = 3. At x=3, y = 3+10 = 13. 3. -x+16 = x+10 => 6 = 2x => x=3. At x=3, y = -3+16 = 13. All three lines intersect at the point (3, 13). The function f(x) is the lower envelope of these three lines. For x < 3, the function is defined by the line with the smallest value, and for x > 3, it's similarly defined. Since the lines 2x+7 and x+10 are increasing and -x+16 is decreasing, the function value increases up to x=3 and decreases afterwards. Thus, the maximum value of f(x) is attained at the common intersection point, which is 13."
