Initial ratio of milk to water = 7:3.
Initial quantity of milk M₀ = (7/10)V. Initial quantity of water W₀ = (3/10)V.
When 20 litres of mixture is removed:
Milk removed = (7/10) × 20 = 14 litres.
Water removed = (3/10) × 20 = 6 litres.
Milk remaining M₁ = (7/10)V - 14.
Water remaining W₁ = (3/10)V - 6.
20 litres of pure milk is added. The total volume remains V.
New quantity of milk M₂ = M₁ + 20 = (7/10)V - 14 + 20 = (7/10)V + 6.
New quantity of water W₂ = W₁ = (3/10)V - 6.
The new ratio of milk to water is 11:3.
So, ((7/10)V + 6) / ((3/10)V - 6) = 11/3.
3((7/10)V + 6) = 11((3/10)V - 6).
(21/10)V + 18 = (33/10)V - 66.
18 + 66 = (33/10)V - (21/10)V.
84 = (12/10)V = (6/5)V.
V = (84 × 5) / 6 = 14 × 5 = 70 litres.

For c = 4x-11 to be the longest side, it must be greater than the other two sides:
1. 4x-11 > 3x-7  =>  x > 4.
2. 4x-11 > x-1  =>  3x > 10  => x > 10/3.
The intersection of these conditions is x > 4.
Since x is an integer, x ≥ 5.
The triangle inequality (a+b > c) is (x-1)+(3x-7) > 4x-11 => 4x-8 > 4x-11, which is always true.

Check x=5: Sides are 4, 8, 9. 4²+8² = 16+64=80. 9²=81. 80 < 81, so it is obtuse.

Expenditure for first 4 months = 4 × 2750 = Rs. 11000.
Expenditure for next 3 months = 3 × 2900 = Rs. 8700.
Expenditure for last 5 months = 5 × 3120 = Rs. 15600.
Total annual expenditure = 11000 + 8700 + 15600 = Rs. 35300.
Total annual savings = Rs. 5460.
We know that Income = Expenditure + Savings.
Total annual income = 35300 + 5460 = Rs. 40760.
To find the average monthly income, divide the total annual income by 12.
Average monthly income = Total Annual Income / 12 = 40760 / 12.
40760 / 12 = 20380 / 6 = 10190 / 3 = 3396.66...

Divisibility by 8: The number formed by the last three digits, 2Y6, must be divisible by 8.
Let's test values for Y: 200 is divisible by 8, so we need 10Y + 6 to be divisible by 8.
- If Y=1, 10(1)+6 = 16. 16 is divisible by 8. So Y=1 is possible.
- If Y=5, 10(5)+6 = 56. 56 is divisible by 8. So Y=5 is possible.
- If Y=9, 10(9)+6 = 96. 96 is divisible by 8. So Y=9 is possible.
Possible values for Y are 1, 5, 9.
Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits, 5+X+2+Y+6, must be divisible by 9.
Sum = 13 + X + Y.
We test each possible value of Y to find X and then X+Y.
Case 1: Y = 1. The sum is 13 + X + 1 = 14 + X. For this to be divisible by 9, 14+X must be 18 (since X is a single digit). This gives X=4. Here, X+Y = 4+1 = 5.
Case 2: Y = 5. The sum is 13 + X + 5 = 18 + X. For this to be divisible by 9, 18+X can be 18 or 27. This gives X=0 or X=9. Here, X+Y can be 0+5=5 or 9+5=14.
Case 3: Y = 9. The sum is 13 + X + 9 = 22 + X. For this to be divisible by 9, 22+X must be 27. This gives X=5. Here, X+Y = 5+9=14.
The possible values for X+Y are 5 and 14. The minimum possible value is 5."

Let them meet after time t₀.
Distance PM = S_A × t₀. Distance QM = S_B × t₀.
After meeting, A travels QM and B travels PM.
Let t_A' be the time for A to travel QM, so t_A' = QM / S_A = (S_B × t₀) / S_A.
Let t_B' be the time for B to travel PM, so t_B' = PM / S_B = (S_A × t₀) / S_B.
We are given S_A / S_B = 5/4.
We are also given t_B' = t_A' + 16.
A standard result for such problems is (S_A / S_B)² = t_B' / t_A'.
(5/4)² = t_B' / t_A'
25/16 = t_B' / t_A' => t_B' = (25/16)t_A'.
Substitute this into the given time difference equation:
(25/16)t_A' = t_A' + 16
(25/16 - 1)t_A' = 16
(9/16)t_A' = 16 => t_A' = (16 × 16) / 9 = 256/9 minutes.
Then, t_B' = t_A' + 16 = 256/9 + 16 = (256 + 144)/9 = 400/9 minutes.
Another standard result is that the meeting time t₀ = sqrt(t_A' × t_B').
t₀ = sqrt((256/9) × (400/9)) = sqrt((16²/3²) × (20²/3²)) = (16/3) × (20/3) = 320/9 minutes.
The total time for B to travel from Q to P is the time to reach the meeting point M (t₀) plus the time to travel from M to P (t_B').
Total time for B = t₀ + t_B' = 320/9 + 400/9 = 720/9 = 80 minutes.

(1-r)² = (1/2)² = 1/4.
Now, substitute the known values into the formula:

1. The radius of the sector becomes the slant height (L) of the cone.
2. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
Given: Radius of the sector, R_sec = 15 cm. Central angle of the sector, θ_sec = 216°.
From (1), the slant height of the cone L = 15 cm.
From (2), we first calculate the arc length of the sector:
Arc Length = (θ_sec / 360°) × 2πR_sec
Arc Length = (216 / 360) × 2π(15).
Simplify the fraction: 216/360 = (72 × 3) / (72 × 5) = 3/5.
Arc Length = (3/5) × 2π(15) = 3 × 2π × 3 = 18π cm.
This arc length is the circumference of the cone's base. Let the radius of the cone's base be r_cone.
Circumference of cone's base = 2πr_cone.
So, 2πr_cone = 18π.
Divide by 2π: r_cone = 9 cm.

This work is equal to 1/3 of the total project: W/3 = 2400 man-days.
From this, the total work required is W = 3 × 2400 = 7200 man-days.
Remaining work = W - W/3 = 2W/3 = 2/3 × (7200) = 4800 man-days.

Remaining time = 100 - 40 = 60 days.
Let N be the total number of workers required for the remaining period.
The work to be done by these N workers in 60 days must equal the remaining work.
N workers × 60 days = 4800 man-days.
