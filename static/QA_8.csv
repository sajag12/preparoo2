Given f_min + f_max = 7.5.
(3 + min |x-a|) + (3 + max |x-a|) = 7.5.
min |x-a| + max |x-a| = 1.5.
The function g(x) = |x-a| measures the distance from x to a. The maximum distance from any point in [2,5] to 'a' will be at one of the endpoints, x=2 or x=5. So, max |x-a| = max(|2-a|, |5-a|).
Case 1: a ∈ [2, 5].
The minimum distance is 0 (at x=a). So min |x-a| = 0.

To arrive at Q on schedule, it has to increase its speed by 50% of its original scheduled speed for the rest of the journey. If the scheduled time for the entire journey was 2 hours 30 minutes, find the value of 'd'.",MCQ,901234567,QA,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let total distance be D and scheduled time T_sch = 2.5 hours = 150 minutes.
Original speed S_orig = D / 150.
Part 1: Distance d₁ = 0.4D. Time taken t₁ = 0.5 × 150 = 75 minutes.
Remaining distance d₂ = 0.6D.
Time remaining in the schedule for this part = 150 - 75 = 75 minutes.
Due to a delay of 'd' minutes, the time available is (75 - d) minutes.
New speed for the rest of the journey S₂ = 1.5 S_orig.
Time taken for the second part is t₂ = d₂ / S₂ = 0.6D / (1.5 S_orig) = 0.6D / (1.5 * (D/150)) = (0.6 * 150) / 1.5 = 60 minutes.
This time taken must equal the available time.
60 = 75 - d.
d = 15 minutes.

In 20 litres of mixture removed, milk removed = (7/10)×20 = 14 L, water removed = (3/10)×20 = 6 L.
Remaining milk = 7k - 14. Remaining water = 3k - 6.
20 litres of water is added.
New milk = 7k - 14. New water = (3k - 6) + 20 = 3k + 14.
New ratio is (7k - 14) / (3k + 14) = 7/5.
7(k - 2) / (3k + 14) = 7/5.
(k - 2) / (3k + 14) = 1/5.
