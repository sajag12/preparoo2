Let expenditures of A and B be 4m and 5m respectively.
A's savings = Income of A - Expenditure of A = 3k - 4m.
A saves 25% of his income, so A's savings = 0.25 × 3k = (3/4)k.
Therefore, 3k - 4m = (3/4)k.
3k - (3/4)k = 4m
(9/4)k = 4m => m = 9k/16.
B's savings = Income of B - Expenditure of B = 4k - 5m.
Substitute m = 9k/16 into B's savings:
B's savings = 4k - 5(9k/16) = 4k - 45k/16 = (64k - 45k)/16 = 19k/16.
Total savings = A's savings + B's savings = (3/4)k + 19k/16 = 12k/16 + 19k/16 = 31k/16.
Given total savings = Rs. 23,250.
31k/16 = 23250.
k = (23250 × 16) / 31 = 750 × 16 = 12000.

This means 24 hours of actual time correspond to 23 hours 45 minutes (23.75 hours) on the faulty clock.
Ratio of Actual Time / Clock Time = 24 / 23.75 = 24 / (95/4) = 96/95.
The time indicated by the clock is from Monday 10:00 AM to Wednesday 3:00 PM.
Duration = 24 hrs (Mon 10AM to Tue 10AM) + 24 hrs (Tue 10AM to Wed 10AM) + 5 hrs (Wed 10AM to Wed 3PM) = 53 clock hours.
Actual time passed = 53 × (96/95) hours = 5088 / 95 hours.
Performing the division: 5088 ÷ 95 gives a quotient of 53 and a remainder of 53. So, the time passed is 53 and 53/95 hours.
The fractional part is (53/95) hours = (53/95) × 60 minutes ≈ 33.47 minutes.
So, actual time passed is 53 hours and approx. 33 minutes.

In how many years will it become 32 times itself at the same rate?",MCQ,Q196,QA,40,MockSet_CAT_QA_004,"Let Principal=P, rate=R, Amount=A. A = P(1 + R/100)ᵗ.
In 15 years, amount becomes 8P.
8P = P(1 + R/100)¹⁵ => 8 = (1 + R/100)¹⁵.
2³ = (1 + R/100)¹⁵.
Taking the 15th root: 2^(3/15) = 1 + R/100 => 2^(1/5) = 1 + R/100.
Let T be the time for the amount to become 32P.
32P = P(1 + R/100)ᵀ => 32 = (1 + R/100)ᵀ.
2⁵ = (2^(1/5))ᵀ = 2^(T/5).
Equating the powers of 2: 5 = T/5 => T = 25 years.

Applying,Venn diagrams and set theory for 'exactly one' category,900,"Two_Sets, Inclusion-Exclusion, Exactly_One_Set",Medium,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,21,"In an examination, 70% of the candidates passed in English, 65% passed in Mathematics, and 15% failed in both subjects. If 315 candidates passed in exactly one subject, what was the total number of candidates who appeared for the examination?",TITA,Q197,QA,40,MockSet_CAT_QA_004,"Let P(E) be the percentage passing in English and P(M) be for Maths.
P(E) = 70%, P(M) = 65%.
Percentage failing in both, P(E' ∩ M') = 15%.
By De Morgan's laws, P(E∪M) = 1 - P(E' ∩ M') = 100% - 15% = 85%.
This is the percentage of candidates who passed in at least one subject.
P(E∪M) = P(E) + P(M) - P(E∩M).
85% = 70% + 65% - P(E∩M).
85% = 135% - P(E∩M) => P(E∩M) = 50%. This is the percentage who passed both.
Percentage passing in exactly one subject = P(E∪M) - P(E∩M) = 85% - 50% = 35%.
Given that 315 candidates passed in exactly one subject.
Let T be the total number of candidates. 0.35 × T = 315.
T = 315 / 0.35 = 31500 / 35 = 900.
The total number of candidates was 900.
The answer is 900.",Set Theory & Venn Diagrams,Modern Maths

(x + 1/x)² = x² + 1/x² + 2(x)(1/x) = 7 + 2 = 9.
Since x > 0, we take the positive root: x + 1/x = 3.
The identity for the sum of cubes is x³ + 1/x³ = (x + 1/x)³ - 3(x)(1/x)(x + 1/x).
