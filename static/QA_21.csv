QA,,Q45,1,,,"A bus has a fixed schedule for its daily route of 300 km. One day, it started 1 hour late. To compensate, it travelled the first 40% of the route at its scheduled speed, and then increased its speed by 33.33% (or 1/3rd) for the remaining 60% of the route, ultimately arriving at its destination exactly on schedule. What is the scheduled speed of the bus in km/hr?",45,60,75,90,A,B,C,D,A,MCQ,Arithmetic,"Time, Speed & Distance (General)",Hard,"Time, Speed, and Distance with variable speed","Piecewise Speed, Scheduled Time, Algebraic Modelling",FALSE,MockSet1_QA,Analyzing,"Let S be the scheduled speed in km/hr and T be the scheduled time in hours. The route length D = 300 km.
So, D = ST, which means T = 300/S.
One day, the bus started 1 hour late. To arrive on schedule, the actual travel time must be T - 1 hours.
First 40% of the route = 0.4 * 300 = 120 km. Time taken for this part = 120/S hours.
Remaining 60% of the route = 0.6 * 300 = 180 km.
Speed for this part is increased by 33.33% (1/3rd). New speed = S + S/3 = 4S/3 km/hr.
Time taken for this part = 180 / (4S/3) = (180 * 3) / (4S) = 540 / 4S = 135/S hours.
Total actual travel time = (120/S) + (135/S) = 255/S hours.
This total actual travel time must be equal to T - 1:
255/S = (300/S) - 1
1 = 300/S - 255/S
1 = 45/S
S = 45 km/hr.

Digits a, b, c, d are distinct and non-zero (a,b,c,d ∈ {1, ..., 9}).
Condition 1: abcd is divisible by 11. This means (d+b) - (c+a) is a multiple of 11.
Condition 2: a+d = b+c.
Substituting Condition 2 into the divisibility rule: (a+d) - (a+d) = 0. Since 0 is a multiple of 11, Condition 1 is satisfied if Condition 2 holds.
Condition 3: a+b+c+d = 24.
Using Condition 2, let K = a+d = b+c. Then K+K = 24 => 2K = 24 => K = 12.
So, a+d = 12 and b+c = 12.
Condition 4: a > d.
We want to maximize the number abcd, so 'a' should be maximized first, then 'b', then 'c'.
For a+d = 12, a > d, and a,d are distinct non-zero:
Possible (a,d) pairs: (9,3), (8,4), (7,5).
To maximize abcd, we choose the largest 'a', so a=9, d=3. (Digits used: 9, 3).

Given Area(ΔAOB) = 16 sq. units and Area(ΔCOD) = 25 sq. units.
So, 16 * 25 = X * X = X².
X² = 400 => X = 20 sq. units (since area must be positive).
The area of the quadrilateral ABCD is the sum of the areas of the four triangles:

So the k-th term T_k = (1-x^k) / (k!(1-x)).
S = Σ_{k=1 to ∞} T_k = Σ_{k=1 to ∞} [ (1-x^k) / (k!(1-x)) ]
S = (1/(1-x)) * [ Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (1/k!) - Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (x^k/k!) ]
We know the Taylor series for e: e = Σ_{k=0 to ∞} (1/k!) = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + ... = 1 + Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (1/k!).
So, Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (1/k!) = e - 1.
Similarly for e^x: e^x = Σ_{k=0 to ∞} (x^k/k!) = x⁰/0! + x¹/1! + x²/2! + ... = 1 + Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (x^k/k!).
So, Σ_{k=1 to ∞} (x^k/k!) = e^x - 1.
Substituting these into the sum S:

S = (1/(1-x)) * [ e - 1 - e^x + 1 ]
S = (1/(1-x)) * (e - e^x) = (e - e^x) / (1-x).

Let AD = s1 = 8, BC = s2 = 6. Let PQ = z.
Let P divide AD in the ratio k:(1-k) starting from A (i.e., AP = ks1, PD = (1-k)s1).
Since PQ || AB || CD, Q divides BC in the same ratio k:(1-k) starting from B (i.e., BQ = ks2, QC = (1-k)s2).
The length of PQ is given by the formula z = (1-k)a + kb.

Given that these perimeters are equal:

k = 24/28 = 6/7.
Now, substitute k back into the expression for PQ:
PQ = z = 10 + 10k = 10 + 10(6/7) = 10 + 60/7 = (70+60)/7 = 130/7.
The length of PQ is 130/7 cm.

So, x^x = (x²)^(√x).
Using the exponent rule (a^b)^c = a^(bc): x^x = x^(2√x).
Case 1: x = 1. If x = 1, then 1^1 = 1^(2√1) => 1 = 1. This is a valid solution. If x=1, then y = x² = 1² = 1. For this pair, x+y = 1+1 = 2.
Case 2: x > 0 and x ≠ 1. Since the bases are equal and not 1, we can equate the exponents: x = 2√x. Since x > 0, we can divide both sides by √x: √x = 2. Squaring both sides: x = 4. If x=4, then y = x² = 4² = 16. For this pair, x+y = 4+16 = 20.

QA,,Q62,18,,,"There are four cities A, B, C, and D. There are 3 roads from A to B, 4 roads from B to C, 2 roads from A to D, and 3 roads from D to C. A person wants to travel from A to C. How many distinct routes are there from A to C, if a route cannot visit the same city more than once?",,,,,,,,,18,TITA,Modern Maths,Permutations & Combinations,Easy,Counting routes using fundamental principle of counting,"Path Counting, Network Routes, Fundamental Principle of Counting",TRUE,MockSet1_QA,Understanding,"A person wants to travel from A to C. The possible paths are through B or through D.
Case 1: Path via B (A -> B -> C).
Number of ways = (Roads from A to B) × (Roads from B to C) = 3 × 4 = 12.
Case 2: Path via D (A -> D -> C).
Number of ways = (Roads from A to D) × (Roads from D to C) = 2 × 3 = 6.
These two cases are mutually exclusive. Total number of distinct routes is the sum of the ways for each case.
Total routes = 12 + 6 = 18.
The final answer is 18."
QA,,Q63,19,,,"Let f(n) = n * (sum of divisors of n). For example, f(6) = 6 * (1+2+3+6) = 6 * 12 = 72. If k is the smallest integer such that f(k) > 1000, what is the sum of the digits of k?",,,,,,,,,6,TITA,Algebra,Functions,Hard,Analysis of a number-theoretic function and finding a minimum value,"Number Theoretic Functions, Sum of Divisors, Minimization, Iteration",TRUE,MockSet1_QA,Analyzing,"f(n) = n * σ(n), where σ(n) is the sum of divisors of n. We need the smallest integer k such that f(k) > 1000.
Let's test values for k starting from a reasonable number.
f(20) = 20 * σ(20) = 20 * (1+2+4+5+10+20) = 20 * 42 = 840.
f(21) = 21 * σ(21) = 21 * (1+3+7+21) = 21 * 32 = 672.
f(22) = 22 * σ(22) = 22 * (1+2+11+22) = 22 * 36 = 792.
f(23) = 23 * σ(23) = 23 * (1+23) = 23 * 24 = 552.
f(24) = 24 * σ(24) = 24 * σ(2³ * 3¹) = 24 * ( (2⁴-1)/(2-1) * (3²-1)/(3-1) ) = 24 * (15 * 4) = 24 * 60 = 1440.
We found f(24) > 1000. All values tested for k < 24 gave f(k) < 1000. So, k=24 is the smallest integer.
The sum of the digits of k=24 is 2+4=6.
The final answer is 6."

Two people join, their total age is 20 + 50 = 70.
New total age (for N+2 people) = 30N + 70.
One person aged X leaves. 
Final total age (for N+1 people) = 30N + 70 - X.
Final average age = (30N + 70 - X) / (N+1).
Given this average is 31.
(30N + 70 - X) / (N+1) = 31
30N + 70 - X = 31(N+1)
30N + 70 - X = 31N + 31

D is on BC with BD:DC = 2:3, so BD = (2/5)BC.
Triangles ABD and ABC share the same altitude from vertex A. The ratio of their areas equals the ratio of their bases.
[ABD] / [ABC] = BD/BC = 2/5 => [ABD] = (2/5)[ABC].
E is on AD with AE:ED = 1:2, so AE = (1/3)AD.
Triangles ABE and ABD share the same altitude from vertex B. The ratio of their areas equals the ratio of their bases.
