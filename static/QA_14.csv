Let f_min be the minimum value of f(x) on [2,5] and f_max be the maximum value.

f_max = 3 + max(x ∈ [2,5]) |x-a|. Let M(a) = max(x ∈ [2,5]) |x-a|.
Given f_min + f_max = 7.5.
So, (3 + m(a)) + (3 + M(a)) = 7.5.
6 + m(a) + M(a) = 7.5.
m(a) + M(a) = 1.5.
Case 1: a ∈ [2,5].
In this case, m(a) = 0 (achieved when x=a).
M(a) = max(|2-a|, |5-a|). Since a ∈ [2,5], |2-a| = a-2 and |5-a| = 5-a.
So, M(a) = max(a-2, 5-a).
The equation becomes 0 + max(a-2, 5-a) = 1.5.
If a-2 = 1.5, then a = 3.5. This is in [2,5]. For a=3.5, 5-a = 5-3.5 = 1.5. So max(3.5-2, 5-3.5) = max(1.5, 1.5) = 1.5. This is a valid solution. So a=3.5.
Case 2: a < 2.
On [2,5], x-a is always positive. So |x-a| = x-a.
m(a) = |2-a| = 2-a (function x-a is increasing, min at x=2).
M(a) = |5-a| = 5-a (max at x=5).
The equation becomes (2-a) + (5-a) = 1.5.
7 - 2a = 1.5 => 2a = 5.5 => a = 2.75. This contradicts the condition a < 2. So no solution here.
Case 3: a > 5.
On [2,5], x-a is always negative. So |x-a| = -(x-a) = a-x.
m(a) = |5-a| = a-5 (function a-x is decreasing, min at x=5).
M(a) = |2-a| = a-2 (max at x=2).

2a - 7 = 1.5 => 2a = 8.5 => a = 4.25. This contradicts the condition a > 5. So no solution here.

So, N = -(k+2)(3k+2).
We are given N is a non-negative integer and N ≤ 1.
Case 1: N = 0.
-(k+2)(3k+2) = 0.
This means k+2=0 or 3k+2=0. So k=-2 or k=-2/3.
Since k must be an integer, k=-2 is a possible value. This value is in the interval [-2, -2/3].
Case 2: N = 1.
-(k+2)(3k+2) = 1.
(k+2)(3k+2) = -1.
3k² + 2k + 6k + 4 = -1.
3k² + 8k + 4 = -1.
3k² + 8k + 5 = 0.
Factoring the quadratic: (3k+5)(k+1) = 0.
So, k = -5/3 or k = -1.
Since k must be an integer, k=-1 is a possible value. This value is in the interval [-2, -2/3] because -2 ≤ -1 ≤ -2/3.
The possible integer values of k are -2 and -1.

Substitute into the sum of squares: h² + h² = 6050.

h² = 3025.
To find h, note that 50² = 2500 and 60² = 3600. Since 3025 ends in 5, h must end in 5.
Let's check 55: 55² = (50+5)² = 2500 + 2(50)(5) + 25 = 2500 + 500 + 25 = 3025.

(TITA),TITA,432108765,Quantitative Ability,,MockSet1_QA,"We need to find the smallest positive integer k such that 2026^k ≡ 1 (mod 23).
First, find the remainder of 2026 when divided by 23.
2026 = 23 × q + r.
We know 23 × 80 = 1840.
2026 - 1840 = 186.
23 × 8 = 184.
So, 2026 = 23 × 88 + 2.
Thus, 2026 ≡ 2 (mod 23).
The problem reduces to finding the smallest positive integer k such that 2^k ≡ 1 (mod 23).
This k is the order of 2 modulo 23.
By Fermat's Little Theorem, since 23 is a prime number, 2^(23-1) ≡ 2²² ≡ 1 (mod 23).
The order k must be a divisor of 22. The divisors of 22 are 1, 2, 11, 22.
k=1: 2¹ = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 23).
k=2: 2² = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 23).
k=11:
2³ = 8
2⁴ = 16
2⁵ = 32 ≡ 9 (mod 23)
2¹⁰ = (2⁵)² ≡ 9² = 81.
81 = 3 × 23 + 12 (since 3 × 23 = 69). So 2¹⁰ ≡ 12 (mod 23).

The original scheduled speed is S_orig = D / T_sch = D / 150.
Part 1: Distance covered d₁ = 0.4D. Time taken t₁ = 0.5 T_sch = 0.5 × 150 = 75 minutes.
Remaining distance d₂ = D - 0.4D = 0.6D.
Scheduled time for this remaining part would be T_sch - t₁ = 150 - 75 = 75 minutes.
After a delay of 'd' minutes, the time available for the rest of the journey is (75 - d) minutes.
The new speed for the rest of the journey is S₂ = S_orig + 0.5 S_orig = 1.5 S_orig.
The time taken to cover d₂ with speed S₂ is t₂ = d₂ / S₂ = 0.6D / (1.5 S_orig).
Substitute D = 150 S_orig:
t₂ = (0.6 × 150 S_orig) / (1.5 S_orig) = (0.6 × 150) / 1.5 = 90 / 1.5 = 900 / 15 = 60 minutes.
