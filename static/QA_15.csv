QA,,Q45,1,,,"The ratio of the number of boys to girls in a school was 7:8. When 10 boys left the school and 10 girls joined the school, the new ratio of boys to girls became 6:9. What was the original number of girls in the school?",64,72,80,88,A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,Arithmetic,"Ratio, Proportion & Variation",Easy,Solving word problems using ratios and linear equations.,"Ratio manipulation, Linear equations, Word problem",FALSE,MockSet1_QA,Applying,"Let the original number of boys be 7x and the original number of girls be 8x.
After 10 boys left, the number of boys became 7x-10.
After 10 girls joined, the number of girls became 8x+10.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3.
So, we have the equation: (7x-10)/(8x+10) = 2/3.
Cross-multiplying gives: 3(7x-10) = 2(8x+10).
21x - 30 = 16x + 20.
21x - 16x = 20 + 30.
5x = 50.
x = 10.
The original number of girls was 8x = 8 * 10 = 80.

So, (1/6) * Area(ABC) = 28.
Area(ABC) = 28 * 6 = 168 sq. cm.
Points E and F are midpoints of sides CA and AB respectively. △AFE is formed by joining these midpoints.
By the midpoint theorem, the line segment FE is parallel to BC and its length is half the length of BC.
Thus, △AFE is similar to △ABC. The ratio of corresponding sides is AF/AB = AE/AC = FE/BC = 1/2.
The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

For a quadratic equation Ax^2+Bx+C=0, the product of the roots is C/A.
For x^2 - x + 2 = 0, the product of the roots is 2/1 = 2.

OA and OB are radii, so OA=OB. Thus △OAB is isosceles.
Given ∠OAB = 25°, so ∠OBA = 25°.
In △OAB, ∠AOB = 180° - (25°+25°) = 130°.
AT is tangent at A, so radius OA is perpendicular to tangent AT. Thus, ∠OAT = 90°.
The points are collinear in the order T-O-B. So ∠AOT and ∠AOB are supplementary.
∠AOT = 180° - ∠AOB = 180° - 130° = 50°.
In △AOT, the sum of angles is 180°.
∠ATO + ∠TAO + ∠AOT = 180°.
∠ATO + 90° + 50° = 180°.
∠ATO + 140° = 180°.
∠ATO = 40°. ∠ATB is the same as ∠ATO.
The correct option is (D)."

Radius of cone r = 3.5 cm = 7/2 cm. Height of cone h = 7 cm.
Volume of one cone V_c = (1/3)πr^2h = (1/3)π(7/2)^2(7) = (1/3)π(49/4)(7) = (343π)/12 cm^3.

Alternate calculation: N = [(4/3)π(21/2)^3] / [(1/3)π(7/2)^2(7)] = [4(21/2)^3] / [(7/2)^2(7)] = [4 * 9261/8] / [49/4 * 7] = [4630.5] / [343/4] = 4630.5 * 4 / 343 = 18522 / 343 = 54.

QA,,Q63,19,,,The price of petrol increased by 25%. By what percentage must a car owner reduce his consumption of petrol so that his expenditure on petrol increases by only 5%?,,,,,,,,,16,TITA,Arithmetic,Percentages,Easy,"Solving problems involving percentage change in price, consumption, and expenditure.","Percentage increase, Expenditure, Consumption adjustment",TRUE,MockSet1_QA,Applying,"Let the initial price be P and initial consumption be C. Initial expenditure E = P * C.
The new price P' = P(1+0.25) = 1.25P.
Let the new consumption be C'. The new expenditure E' = P' * C' = 1.25P * C'.
The expenditure increases by 5%, so E' = E(1+0.05) = 1.05E = 1.05PC.
Equating the expressions for E':
1.25P * C' = 1.05PC.
1.25C' = 1.05C.
C' = (1.05 / 1.25) * C = (105 / 125) * C = (21/25)C.
The reduction in consumption is C - C' = C - (21/25)C = (4/25)C.
Percentage reduction = ((4/25)C / C) * 100% = (4/25) * 100% = 16%.
The percentage reduction is 16."

We need to find f(72).
First, prime factorize 72: 72 = 8 * 9 = 2^3 * 3^2.
So, f(72) = f(2^3 * 3^2).
Using the properties of the function:
f(72) = f(2^3) + f(3^2).
f(72) = 3*f(2) + 2*f(3).
Given f(2)=3 and f(3)=5.
f(72) = 3*(3) + 2*(5) = 9 + 10 = 19.

The smallest three-digit number is 100. To find the first term: 7k+3 ≥ 100 => 7k ≥ 97 => k ≥ 13.85. So, the smallest k is 14. First number = 7(14)+3 = 101.
The largest three-digit number is 999. To find the last term: 7k+3 ≤ 999 => 7k ≤ 996 => k ≤ 142.28. So, the largest k is 142. Last number = 7(142)+3 = 997.
The sequence of numbers is an arithmetic progression: 101, 108, ..., 997.
First term a = 101, last term l = 997, common difference d = 7.
Number of terms n = (last k - first k) + 1 = (142 - 14) + 1 = 129.
The sum of an AP is S_n = n/2 * (a+l).
S_129 = 129/2 * (101+997) = 129/2 * (1098) = 129 * 549 = 70821.
The sum is 70821."
