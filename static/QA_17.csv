QA,40,492137856,1,,,"A train running from City P to City Q maintains a constant usual speed. Ninety kilometres from P the driver is ordered to reduce speed to 75% of the usual speed, after which the train reaches Q 21 minutes late. Had the same order been given 150 km from P and the train thereafter run at exactly half its usual speed, it would have been only 18 minutes late. What is the train’s usual speed, in km/h?",,,,,,,,,80,TITA,Arithmetic,"Time, Speed & Distance (Trains)",Hard,"Time, Speed & Distance (Trains)","accident speed change, simultaneous equations, proportionality",TRUE,MockSet1_QA_Rev1,Evaluating,"Let the usual speed be v km/h and the total distance be D km.
The usual time taken for a distance x is x/v.
If speed is reduced to 0.75v, the time taken is x/(0.75v) = (4/3)(x/v). Extra time = (1/3)(x/v).
If speed is reduced to 0.5v, the time taken is x/(0.5v) = 2(x/v). Extra time = (x/v).
Case 1: Slowdown after 90 km. Distance affected = D-90.
Extra time: (1/3) * (D-90)/v = 21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 7/20 hours.
So, (D-90)/v = 3 * (7/20) = 21/20 hours. (Equation 1)
Case 2: Slowdown after 150 km. Distance affected = D-150.
Extra time: (D-150)/v = 18 minutes = 18/60 hours = 3/10 hours. (Equation 2)
Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:
((D-90)/v) - ((D-150)/v) = (21/20) - (3/10)
((D-90) - (D-150))/v = (21 - 6)/20
60/v = 15/20 = 3/4
3v = 60 * 4 = 240
v = 240/3 = 80."

If a student is selected at random, the probability that the student studies both Mathematics and English is",0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,Arithmetic,Percentages (Set Based) / Probability,Medium,Percentages (Set Based) / Probability,"Venn diagram, inclusion–exclusion principle, set theory probability",FALSE,MockSet1_QA_Rev1,Analyzing,"Let M be the event that a student studies Mathematics, and E be the event that a student studies English.
P(M) = 0.60.
P(E) = 0.70.
Percentage studying neither subject = 20%. So, P(neither M nor E) = P(not M and not E) = P(not (M or E)) = 0.20.
This means P(M or E) = 1 - P(not (M or E)) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.
We know that P(M or E) = P(M) + P(E) - P(M and E).
0.80 = 0.60 + 0.70 - P(M and E)
0.80 = 1.30 - P(M and E)
P(M and E) = 1.30 - 0.80 = 0.50.
The probability that the student studies both Mathematics and English is 0.50."
