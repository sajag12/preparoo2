What is the value of K?",MCQ,Q45,Quantitative Aptitude,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let Alisha's cost price (CP_A) be C.
Alisha sold to Bhanu at a 20% loss. So, Bhanu's cost price (CP_B) = C * (1 - 0.20) = 0.8C.
Bhanu marked up by 50% of what he paid. Selling price for Bhanu = CP_B * (1 + 0.50) = 0.8C * 1.5 = 1.2C.
This is the price Charan paid. So, Charan's cost price (CP_C) = 1.2C.
We are given CP_C = Rs. 3600.
So, 1.2C = 3600 => C = 3600 / 1.2 = Rs. 3000.
Alisha's cost price (CP_A) = Rs. 3000.
If Alisha had sold the item directly to Charan at Rs. 3600:
Alisha's profit = Selling Price - CP_A = 3600 - 3000 = Rs. 600.

Prime factorization of 225 is `3^2 × 5^2 = 9 × 25`.
For divisibility by 25, the number formed by the last two digits (7q) must be divisible by 25. The only multiple of 25 starting with 7 is 75. So, q = 5.
The number becomes 876p375.
For divisibility by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.
Sum of digits = 8 + 7 + 6 + p + 3 + 7 + 5 = 36 + p.
Since 36 is divisible by 9, for 36 + p to be divisible by 9, p must be divisible by 9.
Given that p is a single digit and p is non-zero, p must be 9.

Thus, D = ST.
Case 1: The train starts 30 minutes (0.5 hours) late. To reach on schedule, it must complete the journey in T - 0.5 hours. The speed is increased by 25%, so new speed S' = S + 0.25S = 1.25S.
D = (1.25S)(T - 0.5).
Since D = ST, we have ST = 1.25S(T - 0.5). Dividing by S (S ≠ 0):
T = 1.25(T - 0.5) => T = 1.25T - 0.625 => 0.25T = 0.625 => T = 2.5 hours.
Case 2: The train travels 60 km at speed S. Time taken = 60/S.
Remaining distance = D - 60. Speed for remaining journey = (3/4)S = 0.75S.
The journey is 40 minutes (2/3 hour) late. The delay occurs only in the second part of the journey.
Actual time for second part - normal time for second part = 2/3 hour.
(D-60)/(0.75S) - (D-60)/S = 2/3.
((D-60)/S) * (1/0.75 - 1) = 2/3 => ((D-60)/S) * (4/3 - 1) = 2/3.
((D-60)/S) * (1/3) = 2/3 => (D-60)/S = 2 => D - 60 = 2S.
We have T = 2.5 and D - 60 = 2S. Also D = ST.
Substitute T=2.5 into D=ST => D = 2.5S, so S = D/2.5 = 0.4D.

Let `w_added` liters of water be added.
New total volume = `100 + w_added`. The amount of acid remains 60 L.
New acid concentration = 60 / (100 + w_added) = 0.40.
60 = 0.4(100 + w_added) => 60 = 40 + 0.4w_added => 20 = 0.4w_added => w_added = 50 liters.

In how many years will Rohan be twice as old as Priya?",MCQ,Q61,Quantitative Aptitude,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let Rohan's present age be R and Priya's be P.
1. `R = 3P + 5`
2. 10 years ago: `R-10 = 5(P-10) + 5 => R-10 = 5P - 45 => R = 5P - 35`.
Equating expressions for R:
`3P + 5 = 5P - 35 => 2P = 40 => P = 20` years.
Substitute P=20 into (1): `R = 3(20) + 5 = 65` years.
Let N be the years from now when Rohan is twice as old as Priya.
`65 + N = 2(20 + N)`
`65 + N = 40 + 2N => N = 25` years.

What is the value of `f(5)`?,MCQ,Q62,Quantitative Aptitude,40,MockSet1_QA,"Given `f(1)=2` and `f(n+1) = 3f(n) - 2`.
This is a linear recurrence relation. We can find the closed-form.
Let the fixed point be c: `c = 3c - 2 => 2c = 2 => c = 1`.
Let `g(n) = f(n) - c = f(n) - 1`.
`g(n+1) = f(n+1) - 1 = (3f(n) - 2) - 1 = 3f(n) - 3 = 3(f(n) - 1) = 3g(n)`.
`g(n)` is a geometric progression with common ratio 3.
`g(1) = f(1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.
`g(n) = g(1) * 3^(n-1) = 1 * 3^(n-1) = 3^(n-1)`.
Since `f(n) = g(n) + 1`, we have `f(n) = 3^(n-1) + 1`.

The unit digit is determined by the unit digit of the base, 3.
The pattern of unit digits of powers of 3 is: 3¹, 3², 3³, 3⁴ -> 3, 9, 7, 1. The cycle length is 4.
To find the unit digit of `3^2024`, we find the remainder of the exponent 2024 when divided by 4.
`2024 ÷ 4 = 506` with a remainder of 0.
A remainder of 0 corresponds to the last digit in the cycle, which is the unit digit of `3^4`.
