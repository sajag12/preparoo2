QA,40,Q45,1,,,"Amit and Sumit start running simultaneously on a circular track of length 1200 meters from the same point, in the same direction. Amit's speed is 7 m/s and Sumit's speed is 3 m/s. After how much time (in seconds) will they meet at the starting point for the second time?",,,,,,,,,2400,TITA,Arithmetic,"Time, Speed & Distance (Races - Linear & Circular)",Medium,"Circular track, Relative speed, Meeting at starting point, LCM of times","Circular track, Relative speed, Meeting at starting point, LCM of times",True,MockSet1_QA,,"Length of the circular track L = 1200 meters.
Speed of Amit S_A = 7 m/s.
Speed of Sumit S_S = 3 m/s.
Time taken by Amit to complete one round = L / S_A = 1200 / 7 seconds.
Time taken by Sumit to complete one round = L / S_S = 1200 / 3 = 400 seconds.
They will meet at the starting point at a time which is the LCM of their individual times to complete one round.
LCM (1200/7, 400/1) = LCM(1200, 400) / HCF(7, 1) = 1200 / 1 = 1200 seconds.
This is the first time they meet at the starting point after starting together.
The second time they meet at the starting point will be after another 1200 seconds from their first meeting at the starting point (which is 2 * time for first meeting at starting point, measured from the initial start).
Time for the second meeting at the starting point = 2 * 1200 = 2400 seconds.
The answer is 2400."
QA,40,Q46,2,,,"A positive integer N consists of 'p' repetitions of the digit 'a' followed by 'q' repetitions of the digit 'b' (e.g., if a=1, p=3, b=2, q=2, N=11122).

Find the value of 'a'.",,,,,,,,,6,TITA,Number System,Divisibility Rules,Hard,"Divisibility by 72, Divisibility by 8, Divisibility by 9, Number Formation, Smallest Integer","Divisibility by 72, Divisibility by 8, Divisibility by 9, Number Formation, Smallest Integer",True,MockSet1_QA,,"The number N is formed by 'p' 'a's followed by 'q' 'b's.
'p' is the smallest even integer greater than 1, so p = 2.
'q' is the smallest odd integer greater than 1, so q = 3.
So N is of the form 'aabbb'.
N is divisible by 72, which means N is divisible by 8 and 9.
Divisibility by 8: The number formed by the last three digits, 'bbb' (which is 111b), must be divisible by 8.
Since 111 is odd, 'b' must be divisible by 8. As 'b' is a non-zero digit, b = 8.
Divisibility by 9: The sum of digits of N must be divisible by 9.
Sum of digits = pa + qb = 2a + 3b.
Substitute b=8: Sum = 2a + 3*8 = 2a + 24.
2a + 24 must be divisible by 9.
'a' is a non-zero digit (1 to 9) and a ≠ b (so a ≠ 8).
Possible values for 2a when a ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9}: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,18.
Corresponding values for 2a + 24: 26,28,30,32,34,36,38,42.
Out of these values, only 36 is divisible by 9.
So, 2a + 24 = 36 => 2a = 12 => a = 6.
This satisfies a ≠ b (6 ≠ 8) and 'a' is a non-zero digit.
The value of 'a' is 6."

This is an identity, but we must check domain constraints: x > 0, x ≠ 1, and 2x-3 > 0 => x > 1.5.
The problem states the equation is satisfied if log₃(2x-3)=0. Let's solve this:
log₃(2x-3) = 0 => 2x-3 = 3⁰ = 1 => 2x = 4 => x = 2. This satisfies the domain constraints (2 > 1.5).

The domain for this case is [5/3, 3). In this range, the LHS is positive (or zero) and the RHS is negative. A positive number is always greater than a negative number, so the inequality holds for all x in [5/3, 3). The positive integers in this interval are x=2.

This means one part of the ratio, k, is equal to 2100 / 6 = Rs. 350.
We need to find C's share of the distributed profit, which is 8k.
C's share = 8 * k = 8 * 350 = Rs. 2800.
The information about A being a working partner and receiving a salary is extra information not needed to solve for C's share of the distributed profit.
The correct option is (C)."

The minimum value of such a function occurs at the median of the numbers a, b, c, ...
In our case, f(x) = |x-2| + |x-4| + |x-6|.
The numbers are 2, 4, and 6.
The median of the set {2, 4, 6} is 4.
So, the minimum value of f(x) will occur at x = 4.
Let's calculate the value of f(4):
f(4) = |4-2| + |4-4| + |4-6|
f(4) = |2| + |0| + |-2|
f(4) = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.
The minimum value of f(x) is 4.
The correct option is (B)."

If the area of the rhombus is 216 sq. cm, find its side length in cm.",,,,,,,,,15,TITA,Mensuration,"Mensuration - 2D (Area & Perimeter: Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Polygons, Circles)",Medium,"Rhombus, Diagonals of Rhombus, Area of Rhombus, Pythagoras Theorem","Rhombus, Diagonals of Rhombus, Area of Rhombus, Pythagoras Theorem",True,MockSet1_QA,,"Let the diagonals of the rhombus be d₁ and d₂.
Given d₁:d₂ = 3:4. Let d₁ = 3k and d₂ = 4k for some constant k.
Area of a rhombus = (1/2) * d₁ * d₂.
Given Area = 216 sq. cm.
216 = (1/2) * (3k) * (4k)
216 = (1/2) * 12k²
216 = 6k²
k² = 216 / 6 = 36
k = 6.
So, the diagonals are d₁ = 3*6 = 18 cm and d₂ = 4*6 = 24 cm.
The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. They form four congruent right-angled triangles with the sides of the rhombus as the hypotenuse.
The legs of these triangles are (d₁/2) and (d₂/2).
Legs are 18/2 = 9 cm and 24/2 = 12 cm.
Let the side of the rhombus be 's'. By Pythagoras theorem:
s² = (d₁/2)² + (d₂/2)²
s² = 9² + 12²
s² = 81 + 144 = 225
s = √225 = 15 cm.
The side length is 15 cm."

If the total time for the round trip (P to Q and back to P) was exactly 43/3 hours, find the normal speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr).",,,,,,,,,10,TITA,Arithmetic,"Time, Speed & Distance (Boats & Streams)",Hard,"Upstream Speed, Downstream Speed, Relative Speed, Variable Speed","Upstream Speed, Downstream Speed, Relative Speed, Variable Speed",True,MockSet1_QA,,"Let the normal speed of the boat in still water be 's' km/hr. Speed of stream = 2 km/hr.
Normal upstream speed = s-2 km/hr. Normal downstream speed = s+2 km/hr.
Upstream Journey:
Part 1: Travels for 2 hours at normal upstream speed. Distance covered = 2 * (s-2) km.
Remaining distance upstream = 60 - 2(s-2) = 60 - 2s + 4 = 64 - 2s km.
Part 2: Engine malfunctions, speed reduces by 20%. New still water speed = 0.8s.
New upstream speed = 0.8s - 2 km/hr.
Time for this part = (64 - 2s) / (0.8s - 2).
Total upstream time = 2 + (64 - 2s) / (0.8s - 2).
Downstream Journey:
Time taken = Distance / Speed = 60 / (s+2).
Total trip time = T_up + T_down = 43/3 hours.
[2 + (64-2s)/(0.8s-2)] + [60/(s+2)] = 43/3
(64-2s)/(0.8s-2) + 60/(s+2) = 43/3 - 2 = 37/3.
This equation is complex to solve algebraically. Let's test integer values for 's'. s must be > 2 for upstream travel, and 0.8s > 2 => s > 2.5.
Let's try s=10 km/hr.
LHS = (64 - 2*10)/(0.8*10 - 2) + 60/(10+2) = (64-20)/(8-2) + 60/12 = 44/6 + 5 = 22/3 + 15/3 = 37/3.
LHS = RHS. So, s=10 is the correct speed.
The normal speed of the boat in still water is 10 km/hr."

A key property of HCF and LCM is that for any two positive integers x and y:
x * y = HCF(x, y) * LCM(x, y)
x * y = 20 * 240 = 4800.
We are also given that x - y = 20, which can be written as x = y + 20.
Substitute this into the product equation:
(y + 20) * y = 4800
y² + 20y = 4800
y² + 20y - 4800 = 0.
This is a quadratic equation for y. We can solve it by factoring.
We need two numbers that multiply to -4800 and add to 20. These are 80 and -60.
(y + 80)(y - 60) = 0.
So, y = -80 or y = 60. Since numbers are positive, y = 60.
Now find x: x = y + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80.
Check conditions: x=80, y=60. x>y (80>60). x-y=20 (80-60=20). HCF(80,60)=20. LCM(80,60)=240. All conditions are satisfied.
The value of x is 80.

The order matters.
Total cards = 52. Number of Kings = 4. Number of Aces = 4. Number of Queens = 4.
Probability of the first card being a King: P(1st is King) = 4/52.
After drawing a King, there are 51 cards left.
Probability of the second card being an Ace, given the first was a King: P(2nd is Ace | 1st is King) = 4/51.
After drawing a King and an Ace, there are 50 cards left.
Probability of the third card being a Queen, given the first two were a King and an Ace: P(3rd is Queen | 1st K, 2nd A) = 4/50.
The probability of this specific sequence is the product of these probabilities:
P(K, A, Q) = P(1st is King) * P(2nd is Ace) * P(3rd is Queen)
P(K, A, Q) = (4/52) * (4/51) * (4/50)

This is a common technique for expressions of the form a + b + ab.
1) x + y + xy = 34  => (x+1)(y+1) = 35
2) y + z + yz = 55  => (y+1)(z+1) = 56
3) z + x + zx = 39  => (z+1)(x+1) = 40
Let A = x+1, B = y+1, C = z+1. Since x, y, z are positive integers, A, B, C must be integers greater than or equal to 2.
The system becomes:
AB = 35
BC = 56
CA = 40
Multiply the three equations: (ABC)² = 35 * 56 * 40
(ABC)² = (5*7) * (7*8) * (8*5) = 5² * 7² * 8² = (5*7*8)²
ABC = 5 * 7 * 8 = 280 (since A,B,C are positive).
Now we can find A, B, C individually:
C = ABC / AB = 280 / 35 = 8.
From C = z+1 => 8 = z+1 => z = 7.
A = ABC / BC = 280 / 56 = 5.
From A = x+1 => 5 = x+1 => x = 4.
B = ABC / CA = 280 / 40 = 7.
From B = y+1 => 7 = y+1 => y = 6.
The solution is x=4, y=6, z=7. These are all positive integers.
We need to find the value of x + y + z.
x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 7 = 17.
The value is 17."
