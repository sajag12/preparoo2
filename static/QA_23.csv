We need to find the probability of drawing exactly 2 blue balls and 1 non-blue ball in 3 draws.
Total ways to choose 3 balls from 12 = C(12, 3) = (12 × 11 × 10) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 220.
Number of ways to choose 2 blue balls from 5 = C(5, 2) = (5 × 4) / 2 = 10.
Number of ways to choose 1 non-blue ball from the remaining 7 (4R + 3G) = C(7, 1) = 7.
Number of favorable outcomes = C(5, 2) × C(7, 1) = 10 × 7 = 70.
Probability = Favorable Outcomes / Total Outcomes = 70 / 220 = 7/22."
QA,40,890112233,22,,,"If log₁₀(x² - 11x + 30) - log₁₀(x - 5) = 1 + log₁₀(2), find x.",16,20,26,30,1,2,3,4,3,MCQ,Algebra,Logarithms,Medium,Logarithms,"Logarithmic Equations, Properties of Logarithms, Domain of Logarithm",FALSE,MockSet1_QA_New,Application,"log₁₀(x² - 11x + 30) - log₁₀(x - 5) = 1 + log₁₀(2).
First, check the domain for the logarithms to be defined:
x² - 11x + 30 > 0 => (x-5)(x-6) > 0 => x < 5 or x > 6.
x - 5 > 0 => x > 5.
The combined domain is x > 6.
Using the property log(a) - log(b) = log(a/b):
log₁₀((x² - 11x + 30)/(x - 5)) = log₁₀(10) + log₁₀(2)
log₁₀(((x-5)(x-6))/(x-5)) = log₁₀(20)
Since x > 6, (x-5) is non-zero and can be cancelled.
log₁₀(x-6) = log₁₀(20)
x - 6 = 20
x = 26.
This value satisfies the domain condition x > 6."
