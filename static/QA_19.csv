From the given data:
1. For x=10, C(10) = A + 10B + C/100 = 2400
2. For x=20, C(20) = A + 20B + C/400 = 1700
3. For x=40, C(40) = A + 40B + C/1600 = 2400

Subtracting equation (2) from (1):
(A + 10B + C/100) - (A + 20B + C/400) = 2400 - 1700
-10B + (C/100 - C/400) = 700
-10B + 3C/400 = 700 (4)

Subtracting equation (3) from (2):
(A + 20B + C/400) - (A + 40B + C/1600) = 1700 - 2400
-20B + (C/400 - C/1600) = -700
-20B + 3C/1600 = -700 (5)

Multiply equation (4) by 2:
-20B + 6C/400 = 1400 => -20B + 3C/200 = 1400 (4')

Subtract equation (5) from (4'):
(-20B + 3C/200) - (-20B + 3C/1600) = 1400 - (-700)
3C/200 - 3C/1600 = 2100
(24C - 3C)/1600 = 2100
21C/1600 = 2100 => C = 160000.

Substitute C=160000 into equation (4):
-10B + 3(160000)/400 = 700
-10B + 3(400) = 700 => -10B + 1200 = 700 => -10B = -500 => B = 50.

Substitute B=50 and C=160000 into equation (1):
A + 10(50) + 160000/100 = 2400
A + 500 + 1600 = 2400 => A + 2100 = 2400 => A = 300.
The fixed component 'A' is Rs. 300.

QS = (2/(2+3)) * 10 = (2/5) * 10 = 4 cm.
SR = (3/(2+3)) * 10 = (3/5) * 10 = 6 cm.

Quantitative Aptitude,,100000017,17,,,"Find the number of integer pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation |x - |y-3|| = 2, given that 0 ≤ y ≤ 5 and |x| ≤ 4.",6,7,8,11,A,B,C,D,D,MCQ,Algebra,Inequalities & Modulus,Medium,Inequalities & Modulus,"Modulus_Equation_Nested, IntegerSolutions_Bounds, CaseAnalysis",FALSE,MockSet_CAT_Adv4_Final_CleanV2,,"|x - |y-3|| = 2.
Constraints: 0 ≤ y ≤ 5 and -4 ≤ x ≤ 4. x, y are integers.
Case 1: y-3 ≥ 0 => y ≥ 3. So y ∈ {3,4,5}.
Then |y-3| = y-3. The equation becomes |x - (y-3)| = 2 => |x-y+3| = 2.
This means x-y+3 = 2 (i.e., x-y = -1) OR x-y+3 = -2 (i.e., x-y = -5).
If y=3: x-3=-1 => x=2 (Valid); x-3=-5 => x=-2 (Valid). Pairs: (2,3), (-2,3).
If y=4: x-4=-1 => x=3 (Valid); x-4=-5 => x=-1 (Valid). Pairs: (3,4), (-1,4).
If y=5: x-5=-1 => x=4 (Valid); x-5=-5 => x=0 (Valid). Pairs: (4,5), (0,5).
Total pairs from Case 1 = 6.
Case 2: y-3 < 0 => y < 3. So y ∈ {0,1,2}.
Then |y-3| = -(y-3) = 3-y. The equation becomes |x - (3-y)| = 2 => |x+y-3| = 2.
This means x+y-3 = 2 (i.e., x+y = 5) OR x+y-3 = -2 (i.e., x+y = 1).
If y=0: x+0=5 => x=5 (Invalid); x+0=1 => x=1 (Valid). Pair: (1,0).
If y=1: x+1=5 => x=4 (Valid); x+1=1 => x=0 (Valid). Pairs: (4,1), (0,1).
If y=2: x+2=5 => x=3 (Valid); x+2=1 => x=-1 (Valid). Pairs: (3,2), (-1,2).
Total pairs from Case 2 = 1+2+2 = 5.
Total number of integer pairs = 6 + 5 = 11.
The correct option is (D)."
Quantitative Aptitude,,100000018,18,,,"A sum of Rs. 16,000 is lent out in two parts. The first part is lent at 8% simple interest per annum and the second part at 12% simple interest per annum. If the total annual interest received is Rs. 1560, but if the rates of interest had been interchanged, the total annual interest would have been Rs. 1640. What is the amount lent at 12% initially?",Rs. 6000,Rs. 7000,Rs. 8000,Rs. 9000,A,B,C,D,B,MCQ,Arithmetic,Simple Interest,Medium,Simple Interest,"SI_SplitPrincipal_DifferentRatesTimes, SystemOfLinearEquations",FALSE,MockSet_CAT_Adv4_Final_CleanV2,,"Let the two parts be P₁ and P₂.
Scenario 1: Total SI = 1560.
(P₁ × 8 × 1)/100 + (P₂ × 12 × 1)/100 = 1560
8P₁ + 12P₂ = 156000 => 2P₁ + 3P₂ = 39000 (1)

Scenario 2 (rates interchanged): Total SI = 1640.
(P₁ × 12 × 1)/100 + (P₂ × 8 × 1)/100 = 1640
12P₁ + 8P₂ = 164000 => 3P₁ + 2P₂ = 41000 (2)

We now have a system of two linear equations.
Multiply equation (1) by 3: 6P₁ + 9P₂ = 117000
Multiply equation (2) by 2: 6P₁ + 4P₂ = 82000

Subtract the new second equation from the new first:
(6P₁ + 9P₂) - (6P₁ + 4P₂) = 117000 - 82000
5P₂ = 35000 => P₂ = 7000.

Substitute P₂=7000 into equation (1):
2P₁ + 3(7000) = 39000
2P₁ + 21000 = 39000 => 2P₁ = 18000 => P₁ = 9000.

The amount lent at 12% initially was P₂. So, P₂ = Rs. 7000.
Check against the question's premise: P₁ + P₂ = 9000 + 7000 = 16,000. This matches the total sum given in the question.
The correct option is (B)."

T₁ = a(1)² + b(1) + c = a+b+c = 7. (1)
T₂ = a(2)² + b(2) + c = 4a+2b+c = 13. (2)
S₃ = T₁+T₂+T₃ = 39. So T₃ = 39 - (T₁+T₂) = 39 - (7+13) = 19.
T₃ = a(3)² + b(3) + c = 9a+3b+c = 19. (3)
From (1), c = 7-a-b. Substitute into (2):
4a+2b+(7-a-b) = 13 => 3a+b+7=13 => 3a+b=6. (4)
Substitute c into (3):
9a+3b+(7-a-b) = 19 => 8a+2b+7=19 => 8a+2b=12 => 4a+b=6. (5)
Subtract (4) from (5): (4a+b) - (3a+b) = 6 - 6 => a=0.
If a=0, then from 3a+b=6, b=6.
From c=7-a-b, c=7-0-6=1.
So, T_n = 0n² + 6n + 1 = 6n+1.
We need T₅ = 6(5)+1 = 30+1 = 31.

The heights of the three cones (the small top cone, the cone up to the middle cut, and the full cone) are in the ratio H/3 : 2H/3 : H, or 1:2:3.
Their volumes are in the ratio 1³ : 2³ : 3³ = 1 : 8 : 27.
Let the volumes of the three parts be V₁, V₂, and V₃.
Volume of Part 1 (top cone) = 1k.
Volume of cone up to 2nd cut = 8k. So, Volume of Part 2 = 8k - 1k = 7k.
Volume of original cone = 27k. So, Volume of Part 3 = 27k - 8k = 19k.
The ratio of volumes of Part 1 : Part 2 : Part 3 is 1k : 7k : 19k.
Given Volume of Part 2 = 140 cm³.
7k = 140 => k = 20.
Volume of Part 3 = 19k = 19 × 20 = 380 cm³.

We need factors that are multiples of 12 (2² × 3¹) but not multiples of 90 (2¹ × 3² × 5¹).
This means we must find the number of factors that are multiples of 12 and subtract those that are also multiples of 90.
A number that is a multiple of both 12 and 90 must be a multiple of their LCM.
LCM(12, 90) = LCM(2²×3¹, 2¹×3²×5¹) = 2² × 3² × 5¹ = 180.
So, we need (Number of factors of N multiple of 12) - (Number of factors of N multiple of 180).

1. Number of factors of N that are multiples of 12 (2² × 3¹):
A factor `2ᵃ3ᵇ5ᶜ` must have `a ≥ 2`, `b ≥ 1`, `c ≥ 0`.
Possible exponents from N = 2⁵3⁴5³:
a: {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 choices)
b: {1, 2, 3, 4} (4 choices)
c: {0, 1, 2, 3} (4 choices)

a: {2, 3, 4, 5} (4 choices)
b: {2, 3, 4} (3 choices)
