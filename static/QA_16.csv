A's savings = 3k - 4m. A saves 25% of his income: 3k - 4m = 0.25 × 3k = (3/4)k.
3k - (3/4)k = 4m => (9/4)k = 4m => 9k = 16m => m = 9k/16.
B's savings = 4k - 5m = 4k - 5(9k/16) = (64k - 45k)/16 = 19k/16.
Total savings = A's savings + B's savings = (3/4)k + 19k/16 = 12k/16 + 19k/16 = 31k/16.
Given total savings = Rs. 23,250.
31k/16 = 23250.
k = (23250 × 16) / 31.

Duration = (24 hours for Mon 10AM to Tue 10AM) + (24 hours for Tue 10AM to Wed 10AM) + (5 hours for Wed 10AM to Wed 3PM) = 53 clock hours.
Actual time passed = 53 × (96/95) hours = (53 × 96) / 95 = 5088 / 95 hours.

P1+P2 = 15500.
Total SI for 3 years = 3000. SI per year = 1000.
0.05 P1 + 0.08 P2 = 1000 => 5 P1 + 8 P2 = 100000.
Multiply P1+P2=15500 by 5: 5P1+5P2 = 77500.
Subtracting: (5P1+8P2) - (5P1+5P2) = 100000 - 77500.
3P2 = 22500 => P2 = 7500.
P1 = 15500 - 7500 = 8000.
Ratio P1:P2 = 8000:7500 = 80:75 = 16:15.
The correct option is (A)."
Quantitative Aptitude,40,102345621,21,,,"In an examination, 70% of the candidates passed in English, 65% passed in Mathematics, and 15% failed in both subjects. If 315 candidates passed in exactly one subject, what was the total number of candidates who appeared for the examination?",,,,,,,,,900,TITA,Modern Maths,Set Theory & Venn Diagrams,Medium,Set Theory & Venn Diagrams,"Three Sets, Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, Exactly One/Two Sets",TRUE,MockSet_CAT_QA_003,,"P(E) = 70%, P(M) = 65%. P(Failed in both) = P(E' ∩ M') = 15%.
P(E∪M)' = 15% => P(E∪M) = 100% - 15% = 85% (passed in at least one).
P(E∪M) = P(E) + P(M) - P(E∩M).
85% = 70% + 65% - P(E∩M).
85% = 135% - P(E∩M) => P(E∩M) = 135% - 85% = 50% (passed in both).
Passed in exactly one = P(E only) + P(M only)
= (P(E) - P(E∩M)) + (P(M) - P(E∩M))
= (70% - 50%) + (65% - 50%) = 20% + 15% = 35%.
Let T be total candidates. 35% of T = 315.
0.35 T = 315 => T = 315 / 0.35 = 31500 / 35 = 900.
The answer is 900."
Quantitative Aptitude,40,102345622,22,,,"If (x² + 1/x²) = 7, and x > 0, what is the value of (x³ + 1/x³)?",12,15,18,2√21,A,B,C,D,C,MCQ,Algebra,Basics of Algebra & Identities,Easy,Basics of Algebra & Identities,"Algebraic Manipulation (x+1/x form), Sum of Cubes",FALSE,MockSet_CAT_QA_003,,"Given x² + 1/x² = 7.
First, find x + 1/x.
(x + 1/x)² = x² + 1/x² + 2(x)(1/x) = 7 + 2 = 9.
Since x > 0, x + 1/x = √9 = 3.
Now, x³ + 1/x³ = (x + 1/x)³ - 3(x)(1/x)(x + 1/x).
= (3)³ - 3(1)(3) = 27 - 9 = 18.
The correct option is (C)."
