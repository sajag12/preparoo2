**Scenario 1:** Markup X%, Discount 20%, Profit 20%.
Selling Price (SP1) = CP * (1 + Profit%/100) = 500 * (1 + 20/100) = 500 * 1.2 = Rs. 600.
Let Marked Price be MP1.
SP1 = MP1 * (1 - Discount%/100) = MP1 * 0.8.
The marked price is given by MP1 = CP * (1 + X/100).
So, 500 * (1 + X/100) * 0.8 = 600.
400 * (1 + X/100) = 600.
1 + X/100 = 600/400 = 1.5.
X/100 = 0.5, so X = 50.

**Scenario 2:** Markup (X+20)%, Discount 30%.
New markup percentage = (50+20)% = 70%.
New Marked Price (MP2) = CP * (1 + 70/100) = 500 * 1.7 = Rs. 850.
New Selling Price (SP2) = MP2 * (1 - 30/100) = 850 * 0.7 = Rs. 595.
Profit2 = SP2 - CP = 595 - 500 = Rs. 95.

'p' is the smallest even integer greater than 1, so p = 2.
'q' is the smallest odd integer greater than 1, so q = 3.
The number N has the form 'aabbb'.
N is divisible by 72, which means N is divisible by both 8 and 9.
**Divisibility by 8:** The number formed by the last three digits, 'bbb' (which is 111b), must be divisible by 8.
Since 111 is odd, for 111b to be divisible by 8, 'b' must be an even digit such that 111b is a multiple of 8. Testing even digits: 111*2=222 (not div by 8), 111*4=444 (not div by 8), 111*6=666 (not div by 8), 111*8=888 (div by 8).
As 'b' is a non-zero digit, b = 8.
**Divisibility by 9:** The sum of digits of N must be divisible by 9.
Sum of digits = pa + qb = 2a + 3b.
Substitute b=8: Sum = 2a + 3(8) = 2a + 24.
2a + 24 must be a multiple of 9.
'a' is a non-zero digit (1 to 9) and a ≠ b (so a ≠ 8).

B's share of this distributed profit is Rs. 2100. This corresponds to 6 parts of the ratio.
6 parts = Rs. 2100.
1 part = Rs. 2100 / 6 = Rs. 350.
C's share of the distributed profit corresponds to 8 parts.
C's share = 8 parts * Rs. 350/part = Rs. 2800.

The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Let the side be 's'.
(d₁/2)² + (d₂/2)² = s².
(18/2)² + (24/2)² = s².

The speed of the stream is 2 km/hr. On its upstream journey, after travelling for 2 hours, the boat's engine malfunctions, and its speed relative to still water for the remainder of the upstream journey is reduced by 20%. If the total time for the round trip (P to Q and back to P) was exactly 43/3 hours, find the normal speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr).",TITA,MockSet1_QA_19,Quantitative Aptitude,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let the normal speed of the boat in still water be 's' km/hr.
Stream speed = 2 km/hr. Upstream speed = s-2, Downstream speed = s+2.
**Upstream Journey (60 km):**
- Part 1: 2 hours at normal speed. Distance = 2(s-2).
- Part 2: Engine malfunctions. New still water speed = 0.8s. New upstream speed = 0.8s-2.
Remaining distance = 60 - 2(s-2) = 60 - 2s + 4 = 64 - 2s.
Time for Part 2 = (64 - 2s) / (0.8s - 2).
Total Upstream Time (T_up) = 2 + (64 - 2s) / (0.8s - 2).
**Downstream Journey (60 km):**
Time for Downstream (T_down) = 60 / (s+2).
**Total Trip Time:**
T_up + T_down = 43/3.
2 + (64 - 2s) / (0.8s - 2) + 60 / (s+2) = 43/3.
(64 - 2s) / (0.8s - 2) + 60 / (s+2) = 43/3 - 2 = 37/3.
Test options or likely integer values for 's'. Let's test s=10.
LHS = (64 - 2*10) / (0.8*10 - 2) + 60 / (10+2)
= (64 - 20) / (8 - 2) + 60 / 12
= 44/6 + 5 = 22/3 + 15/3 = 37/3.
This matches the RHS. The speed is 10 km/hr.","Time, Speed & Distance (Boats & Streams)",Arithmetic

If x-y=20, find x.",MCQ,MockSet1_QA_20,Quantitative Aptitude,40,MockSet1_QA,"Let the two numbers be x and y.
Given: HCF(x,y) = 20, LCM(x,y) = 240, x > y, x - y = 20.
We know that Product of numbers = HCF × LCM.
x * y = 20 * 240 = 4800.
From x - y = 20, we have x = y + 20.
Substitute x in the product equation:
(y + 20) * y = 4800.
y² + 20y - 4800 = 0.
Factoring the quadratic: (y + 80)(y - 60) = 0.
Since y must be a positive integer, y = 60.
Then x = y + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80.
The numbers are 80 and 60. They satisfy all conditions. The value of x is 80.

Vessel X: 120 L. J:W = 7:5 => J=70 L, W=50 L.
Vessel Y: 80 L. J:W = 3:1 => J=60 L, W=20 L.
**Step 1:** Transfer 48 L from X to Y.
Mixture from X is in ratio 7:5.
J transferred = (7/12)*48 = 28 L. W transferred = (5/12)*48 = 20 L.
**State after Step 1:**
Vessel X: J = 70-28=42, W = 50-20=30. Total = 72 L.
Vessel Y: J = 60+28=88, W = 20+20=40. Total = 128 L. (New ratio J:W = 88:40 = 11:5)
**Step 2:** Transfer 32 L from Y to X.
Mixture from Y is in ratio 11:5. Total parts = 16.
J transferred = (11/16)*32 = 22 L. W transferred = (5/16)*32 = 10 L.
**Final State of Vessel X:**
