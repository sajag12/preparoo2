Marked Price (MP) of the stock = C + 0.60C = 1.6C.
Revenue from (2/5) of stock sold at MP = (2/5) * 1.6C = 0.64C.
Remaining stock = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5 of total stock.
Stock sold at 25% discount on MP = (1/2) * (3/5) = 3/10 of total stock.
Selling price for this part = 1.6C * (1 - 0.25) = 1.6C * 0.75 = 1.2C.
Revenue from this (3/10) stock = (3/10) * 1.2C = 0.36C.
Remaining stock = (3/5) - (3/10) = 3/10 of total stock.
Selling price for this part (50% discount on MP) = 1.6C * (1 - 0.50) = 1.6C * 0.50 = 0.8C.

For divisibility by 55, it must be divisible by 5 and 11.
Divisibility by 5 implies Z = 0 or Z = 5.
X, Y, Z are distinct digits, also distinct from 3, 4, 7, 6.
Divisibility by 11 implies the alternating sum of digits is a multiple of 11:
(Z + Y + X + 3) - (6 + 7 + 4) is a multiple of 11.
(X+Y+Z+3) - 17 is a multiple of 11.
X+Y+Z-14 = 11k for some integer k.
So X+Y+Z = 14 + 11k.
The maximum sum of three distinct digits is 9+8+7=24.
If k=0, X+Y+Z=14.
If k=1, X+Y+Z=25 (Impossible).
If k=-1, X+Y+Z=3.
The maximum possible sum is therefore 14. This value must be verified against the constraint that X, Y, and Z are distinct digits not already used in {3, 4, 6, 7}.
Case 1: Z = 0.

If rate increased by 25%, new rate R' = R(1+0.25) = 1.25R.
9800 = P + (P × 1.25R × 3)/100 → (2)
The difference in amounts is due to the increase in interest over 3 years.
Increase in Amount = 9800 - 9440 = Rs. 360.
This increase corresponds to the interest generated by the rate increase (1.25R - R = 0.25R).
Increase in Interest = (P × (0.25R) × 3)/100 = (0.75PR)/100.
So, the interest increase is (0.75PR)/100 = 360.
The original interest for 3 years is SI₁ = (3PR)/100.
Note that (3PR)/100 = 4 × [(0.75PR)/100].
Therefore, SI₁ = 4 × 360 = 1440.
From (1), P = Amount - SI₁ = 9440 - 1440 = 8000.
Now find R using SI₁ = (P × R × T)/100:

A tangent drawn at point A on the circle intersects the line BO extended (through O, away from B) at point T. If ∠OAB = 25°, find the measure of ∠ATB.",MCQ,175648529,Part 1: All Questions,,MockSet1_QA,"In △OAB, OA = OB (radii of the same circle), so it is an isosceles triangle.
Therefore, ∠OBA = ∠OAB = 25°.
The sum of angles in △OAB is 180°, so ∠AOB = 180° - (25° + 25°) = 130°.
The phrase ""line BO extended... through O, away from B"" implies that the points are collinear in the order B-O-T.
Since T, O, B are collinear, ∠AOT and ∠AOB are supplementary angles.
Therefore, ∠AOT = 180° - ∠AOB = 180° - 130° = 50°.
AT is tangent to the circle at A, so the radius OA is perpendicular to the tangent AT. Thus, ∠OAT = 90°.
In △AOT, the sum of angles is 180°.
∠ATB = ∠ATO = 180° - (∠TAO + ∠AOT) = 180° - (90° + 50°) = 180° - 140° = 40°.

Volume of sphere V_s = (4/3)πR³ = (4/3)π(21/2)³ = (4/3)π(9261/8) = 9261π/6 cm³.
Cone radius r = 3.5 = 7/2 cm, height h = 7 cm.
Volume of one cone V_c = (1/3)πr²h = (1/3)π(7/2)²(7) = (1/3)π(49/4)(7) = 343π/12 cm³.
Number of cones N = V_s / V_c = (9261π/6) / (343π/12) = (9261/6) × (12/343) = (9261 × 2) / 343.
Since 21³ = 9261 and 7³ = 343, then 9261/343 = (21/7)³ = 3³ = 27.

So, E = P × C.
New Price P' = 1.25P.
New Expenditure E' = 1.05E = 1.05PC.
Let the new consumption be C'. The new expenditure is also E' = P' × C' = (1.25P) × C'.
So, 1.05PC = (1.25P)C'.
1.05C = 1.25C'.
C' = (1.05/1.25)C = (105/125)C = (21/25)C.
The reduction in consumption = C - C' = C - (21/25)C = (4/25)C.

From the second condition: (1.25e_A + 0.75e_B) × 22 = 1 ⟹ 1.25e_A + 0.75e_B = 1/22.

Find the critical points where the numerator or denominator is zero.

• Interval [1, 4): Let x=2. Expression = (|-1|-2)/(|-3|-1) = -1/2 < 0. This interval is part of the solution.

The probability of drawing balls in the specific sequence Red, then Blue, then Green without replacement is calculated as follows:

P(1st is Red) = 4/12.
