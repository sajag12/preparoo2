Selling price (SP) of one article = Rs. 90 / b.
Profit is 25%, so SP = 1.25 * CP = (5/4) * CP.
90/b = (5/4) * (80/a)
90/b = 400 / (4a)
90/b = 100/a
90a = 100b
9a = 10b.
Given that a > b by 1, so a = b + 1.
Substitute this into the equation:
9(b+1) = 10b
9b + 9 = 10b
b = 9.
Then a = b + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10."

The nth term is given by T_n = ar^(n-1).
Given T4 = ar^3 = 24. (Equation 1)
Given T7 = ar^6 = 192. (Equation 2)
Divide Equation 2 by Equation 1:
(ar^6) / (ar^3) = 192 / 24
r^(6-3) = 8
r^3 = 8
r = 2.
Substitute r = 2 into Equation 1:
a * (2^3) = 24
a * 8 = 24
a = 3.
The first term of the GP is 3."
QA,,784930271,21,,,A five-digit number 7x3y4 is divisible by 72. Find the smallest possible value of (2x + y).,,,,,,,,,4,TITA,Number System,Divisibility Rules,Hard,Applying combined divisibility rules (of 8 and 9 for 72) to find missing digits in a number.,"combined divisibility (8 and 9), missing digits, finding smallest value of expression",TRUE,MockSet3_QA_Clean,,"A number is divisible by 72 if it is divisible by both 8 and 9.
**Divisibility by 8:** The last three digits, 3y4, must be divisible by 8.
Testing values for y: 304/8=38 (y=0 works), 344/8=43 (y=4 works), 384/8=48 (y=8 works).
So, possible values for y are 0, 4, 8.
**Divisibility by 9:** The sum of digits, 7+x+3+y+4 = 14+x+y, must be divisible by 9.
We test each possible value of y:
- **Case 1: y = 0.**
  The sum is 14+x. For this to be divisible by 9, 14+x = 18, so x = 4.
  The value of (2x + y) is 2(4) + 0 = 8.
- **Case 2: y = 4.**
  The sum is 14+x+4 = 18+x. For this to be divisible by 9, 18+x can be 18 (so x=0) or 27 (so x=9).
  If x=0, the value of (2x + y) is 2(0) + 4 = 4.
  If x=9, the value of (2x + y) is 2(9) + 4 = 22.
- **Case 3: y = 8.**
  The sum is 14+x+8 = 22+x. For this to be divisible by 9, 22+x = 27, so x = 5.
  The value of (2x + y) is 2(5) + 8 = 18.
The possible values for (2x + y) are 8, 4, 22, and 18. The smallest value is 4."
