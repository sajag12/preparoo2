The scheduled speed is S_sch = D/T_sch.
On Tuesday:
The bus covers the first 40% of the route (0.4D) in 50% of the scheduled time (0.5T_sch).
The remaining 60% of the route (0.6D) is covered at a speed of 45 km/hr.
Since the bus arrives exactly on time on Tuesday, the total time taken is T_sch.
Time taken for the first 40% is 0.5T_sch.
So, time taken for the remaining 60% must be T_sch - 0.5T_sch = 0.5T_sch.
For this remaining part: Distance = 0.6D, Speed = 45 km/hr, Time = 0.5T_sch.
So, 0.6D = 45 × (0.5T_sch) => 0.6D = 22.5T_sch.
This gives D/T_sch = 22.5 / 0.6 = 225 / 6 = 75/2 = 37.5.
Thus, the scheduled speed S_sch = 37.5 km/hr.
On Monday:
The bus travels at a constant speed S_M, which is 20% less than its scheduled speed.
S_M = S_sch * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 * S_sch = 0.80 * 37.5 = 30 km/hr.
The bus arrives 2 hours late, so the time taken is T_sch + 2.
Distance D = S_M * (T_sch + 2).
So, D = 30 * (T_sch + 2).
We also know D = S_sch * T_sch = 37.5T_sch.
Equating the two expressions for D:
37.5T_sch = 30 * (T_sch + 2).
37.5T_sch = 30T_sch + 60.
7.5T_sch = 60.
T_sch = 60 / 7.5 = 600 / 75 = 8 hours.
Now, calculate the length of the route D:
D = 37.5 * T_sch = 37.5 * 8 = 300 km."

The centers O1, O2, O3 of these circles form an equilateral triangle with side length 2R = 20 cm.
Let G be the centroid of this triangle. G is the center for both C4 and C5.
The distance from G to any vertex (say O1) is d = (Side Length)/√3 = (2R)/√3 = 20/√3 cm.
For C4 (smaller circle, radius r4) in the central void, tangent to C1, C2, C3:
The distance between the center of C1 (O1) and the center of C4 (G) is O1G = d.
Since C1 and C4 are externally tangent, O1G = R + r4.
So, (2R)/√3 = R + r4 => r4 = R(2/√3 - 1).
With R=10 cm, r4 = 10(2/√3 - 1) = 10( (2-√3)/√3 ).
For C5 (larger circle, radius r5) enclosing C1, C2, C3 and tangent to them:
The tangency is internal. The distance between the center of C1 (O1) and the center of C5 (G) is O1G = d.
Since C5 encloses C1 and is tangent to it, O1G = r5 - R.

So, T_n = ( (n+1)² - n² ) / ( n²(n+1)² ).
Splitting the fraction:

S_N = 1/1² - 1/(N+1)² = 1 - 1/(N+1)².
For an infinite series, we find the limit of S_N as N → ∞.

If x,y < 0, then x+y < 0 but √(8xy) > 0, so not possible. Thus x,y ≥ 0.
Squaring (2): (x+y)² = 8xy => x² + 2xy + y² = 8xy => x² - 6xy + y² = 0.
If y=0, then x=0. This makes (x-y)²=0 ≠ 1. So x,y ≠ 0.
Divide by y²: (x/y)² - 6(x/y) + 1 = 0. Let t=x/y. t²-6t+1=0 => t = (6±√32)/2 = 3±2√2.
If x-y=1 (so x>y, x/y > 1), then x/y = 3+2√2.

First, ensure the expression under the square root is non-negative (for the LHS to be real):
x² - 7x + 12 ≥ 0
(x-3)(x-4) ≥ 0.
This holds when x ≤ 3 or x ≥ 4. This is the domain of allowed x values.
Case 1: The RHS (x - 4) is negative.
x - 4 < 0 => x < 4.
Considering the domain, this case applies for x ≤ 3.
If x ≤ 3, then x-4 is negative. The LHS, √(x² - 7x + 12), is always non-negative (if real).
A non-negative number is always greater than a negative number.
So, for all x ≤ 3, the inequality holds.
Case 2: The RHS (x - 4) is non-negative.
x - 4 ≥ 0 => x ≥ 4.
Considering the domain, this case applies for x ≥ 4.
When both sides are non-negative, we can square both sides of the inequality:
x² - 7x + 12 > (x - 4)²
x² - 7x + 12 > x² - 8x + 16
-7x + 12 > -8x + 16
8x - 7x > 16 - 12
x > 4.

From Case 1, all x ≤ 3 satisfy the inequality.
The non-negative integers up to 3 are 0, 1, 2, 3. All these values satisfy x ≤ 3.
So, these integers are 0, 1, 2, 3.

Quantitative Aptitude,40,M1QA24009,9,,,"The roots of the quadratic equation x² - px + q = 0 are α and β, where α and β are distinct.

From Vieta's formulas: α+β = p and αβ = q.
Given that p and q are positive integers. This implies α and β are both positive.
The roots α and β are distinct, so α ≠ β.
The terms α, β, αβ form a geometric progression (GP). This implies the ratio of consecutive terms is constant.
So, β/α = (αβ)/β.
Since β > 0 (as it's a positive root), we can cancel β from (αβ)/β = α.
So, β/α = α, which gives β = α².
Since α ≠ β, we have α² ≠ α. Since α > 0, this means α ≠ 1.
Substitute β = α² into Vieta's formulas:
1.	α + α² = p
2.	α * α² = α³ = q
Since p, q are positive integers, α³ = q must be an integer, and α + α² = p must be an integer.
If α is an integer: Since α > 0 and α ≠ 1, the smallest possible integer value for α is 2.
If α = 2:
β = α² = 2² = 4. (Roots are 2 and 4, which are distinct, satisfying α ≠ β).
p = α + α² = 2 + 4 = 6.
q = α³ = 2³ = 8.
(p=6 and q=8 are positive integers).
The GP formed by α, β, αβ is 2, 4, 8 (common ratio 2). This is valid.
For this case, p+q = 6+8 = 14.
If α is a rational number but not an integer, let α = a/b where gcd(a,b)=1 and b>1.
For α³ = (a/b)³ = q to be an integer, b³ must divide a³. Since gcd(a,b)=1, this implies b=1, which contradicts b>1. So α cannot be a non-integer rational number.
Thus, α must be an integer.
The smallest integer value for α (given α > 0, α ≠ 1) is α=2. This yields p+q = 14.
The next integer value for α is 3.
If α = 3: β = 3² = 9. p = 3+9=12, q = 3³=27. p+q = 12+27=39.
Values of p+q are increasing for α > 2.
Thus, the smallest possible value of p+q is 14."

C works till the end (for all 8 days).
Scenario 1: A leaves before or at the same time as B. This means x ≤ 8-x, so 2x ≤ 8, which implies x ≤ 4.
•	Days 0 to x (duration x days): A, B, C work together. Work done = x * (eA+eB+eC) = x * (1/5) = x/5.
•	Days x to (8-x) (duration (8-x) - x = 8-2x days): B, C work together (A has left). Work done = (8-2x) * (eB+eC) = (8-2x) * (1/10) = (8-2x)/10.
•	Days (8-x) to 8 (duration 8 - (8-x) = x days): C works alone (A and B have left). Work done = x * eC = x/30.
The sum of work done must be 1 (completion of the task):
x/5 + (8-2x)/10 + x/30 = 1.
Multiply by 30 (LCM of 5, 10, 30):
6x + 3(8-2x) + x = 30.
6x + 24 - 6x + x = 30.
x + 24 = 30.
x = 6.
This result (x=6) contradicts the condition for Scenario 1 (x ≤ 4). So, this scenario is not valid.
Scenario 2: B leaves before A. This means 8-x < x, so 2x > 8, which implies x > 4.
•	Days 0 to (8-x) (duration 8-x days): A, B, C work together. Work done = (8-x) * (eA+eB+eC) = (8-x) * (1/5) = (8-x)/5.
•	Days (8-x) to x (duration x - (8-x) = 2x-8 days): A, C work together (B has left). Work done = (2x-8) * (eA+eC) = (2x-8) * (2/15).
•	Days x to 8 (duration 8-x days): C works alone (A and B have left). Work done = (8-x) * eC = (8-x)/30.
The sum of work done must be 1:
(8-x)/5 + (2x-8)(2/15) + (8-x)/30 = 1.
Multiply by 30:
6(8-x) + 22(2x-8) + (8-x) = 30.
48 - 6x + 4(2x-8) + 8 - x = 30.
48 - 6x + 8x - 32 + 8 - x = 30.
(-6x + 8x - x) + (48 - 32 + 8) = 30.
x + 24 = 30.
x = 6.
This result (x=6) satisfies the condition for Scenario 2 (x > 4, since 6 > 4).
So, x=6 is the correct value."

For the sum to be finite and defined, we must have |r| < 1.
The sum of an infinite GP is S_inf = a / (1-r).
Given S_inf = 24, so a / (1-r) = 24. (Equation 1)
The terms of the GP are a, ar, ar², ar³, ...
The squares of these terms are a², (ar)², (ar²)², (ar³)², ... which are a², a²r², a²r⁴, a²r⁶, ...
This is also a geometric progression with first term A = a² and common ratio R_sq = r².
Since |r| < 1, r² < 1, so |R_sq| < 1.
The sum of the squares of the terms is S_sq_inf = A / (1-R_sq) = a² / (1-r²).
Given S_sq_inf = 288, so a² / (1-r²) = 288. (Equation 2)
From Equation 1, a = 24(1-r). Substitute this into Equation 2:
(24(1-r))² / (1-r²) = 288.
(24² * (1-r)²) / ((1-r)(1+r)) = 288.
Since |r|<1, 1-r ≠ 0. We can cancel one (1-r) factor:
(576 * (1-r)) / (1+r) = 288.
Since 576/288 = 2:
2 * (1-r) / (1+r) = 1.
2(1-r) = 1(1+r).
2 - 2r = 1 + r.
2 - 1 = r + 2r.
1 = 3r.
r = 1/3.

Now find 'a' using Equation 1:
a = 24(1-r) = 24(1 - 1/3) = 24(2/3) = 16.
The problem states that the first term 'a' is an integer. Our value a=16 is an integer.

If the solution set for x consists of exactly a single point, this means that k must be the minimum value of the function f(x).
The function f(x) is a sum of absolute value functions. The minimum value of such a function occurs at one of its critical points (where the argument of an absolute value becomes zero).
The critical points are:
1.	2x - 5 = 0 => x = 5/2 = 2.5
2.	x + 3 = 0 => x = -3
We evaluate f(x) by considering intervals defined by these critical points:
Case 1: x < -3
